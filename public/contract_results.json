All work under this contract is to be built on work done to date on the development of a modernized contract model for PSPC, in preparation for the implementation of an Electronic Procurement Solution. Following an internal discussion on the content of the modernized contract model and its focus on core clauses, it has been agreed to expand the scope of the model to include modernized versions of the standard procurement clauses currently referenced by PSPC in the Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual. The standard procurement clauses are located in Section 5 of the SACC Manual, and can be categorized as Generalizable or Commodity-Specific. The scope of this Task Authorization is on the generalizable clauses, which comprise 285 clauses; a future Task Authorization will address the commodity-specific clauses. It is recognized that some of the generalizable clauses are duplicates of clauses in other sections that have previously been modernized. In addition, some Section 5 generalizable clauses have been modernized in previous iterations of the model. As such, there is a perceived efficiency in conducting a comparative analysis of Section 5 generalizable clauses prior to modernization, to avoid duplicating previous modernization tasks. This analysis will be conducted on identified sub-sets of Section 5 generalizable clauses (called “batches”), each comprising approximately 50 clauses.",
