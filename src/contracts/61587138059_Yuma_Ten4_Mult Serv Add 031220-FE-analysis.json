  "Executive Summary": {
    "Overall Score": 6.5,
    "Key Strengths": [
      "Initial service term of 36 months aligns with best practices.",
      "Clear provisions for service delivery and escalation.",
      "Defined payment terms with a reasonable late fee structure."
    ],
    "Critical Weaknesses": [
      "Unclear termination provisions and early termination fees.",
      "Lack of comprehensive service level agreements (SLAs) and credit mechanisms.",
      "Insufficient data protection and regulatory compliance measures."
    ],
    "Priority Recommendations": [
      "Clarify termination provisions and early termination fees to ensure fairness.",

      "Provisions with Detailed Analysis": {
        "Clause": "Service Term",
        "Commentary": "The initial term is 36 months, which is optimal. Auto-renewal is month-to-month with 60 days' notice, which is acceptable but could be improved to 45 days."
      },

      "Improvement Opportunities": "Consider reducing the termination notice period to 45 days."

      "Provisions with Detailed Analysis": {
        "Clause": "Charges and Payments",
