conditions stated herein; the NITEL Service Guide located at http://serviceguide.nitelusa.com (Service Guide); the Service Level
Agreements located at http:/Avww,nitelusa.com/sla.htm (collectively referred to as the "SLA); and the NITEL Acceptable Use Policy

GENERAL TERM AND CONDITIONS
4. Service Orders & Term. Customer must submit requests for Service in a manner and on a form designated by NITEL (Service
Order). Each Service Order will state the term for which Service is requested (the Initial Service Term) and the pricing for the Service.
Upon expiration of the Initial Service Term, the Service will renew for a period equal to the Initial Service Term ("Renewal Term) unless
terminated by Customer or NITEL. In order to terminate the Service, prior to renewal, Customer must provide Nitel with written notice
forty-five (45) days prior to the Initial Service Term (or any subsequent Renewal Term), The Initial Service Term and any Renewal Term
are collectively referred to herein as Term. If Customer wishes to terminate (disconnect) a Service for any reason, Customer is required
to follow the disconnection process set forth in the Service Guide. After the Initial Service Term, NITEL may modify the rate for a Service
upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to Customer.
2. Service Installation and Acceptance.
a, Nitel will issue Firm Order Commitment (the "FOC") date for a Service to the Customer. Customer acknowledges that FOC dates can
change from time to time for various reasons. If Nitel changes the FOC date, NITEL will provide Customer with the updated FOC date.
NITELs inability or failure to deliver any ordered Service by the FOC Date will not be a default under the Agreement, and NITEL will not
be liable to Customer as a result of NITELs inability or failure to deliver the Service. If Nitel fails to deliver the Service within thirty (30)
days after the FOC, Customer may terminate the affected Service without liability.
b. NITEL will attempt to provide Service by the requested installation date, but will not be liable for any delays in Service delivery. The
"Start of Service Date refers to the date that the Service is available for use by Customer, subject to the following Service acceptance
process. After NITEL notifies Customer that a Service is available, Customer may test the Service to determine if the Service is operating
in accordance with the technical specifications set forth in the applicable SLA. If Customer provides NITEL with written notice that a
Service is in material non-compliance with the applicable SLA within two (2) business days after NITEL notifies Customer that the Service
is available, then NITEL will promptly take such reasonable action as is necessary to correct any such non-compliance in the Service and
shall, upon correction, notify Customer of a new Start of Service Date. Any non-compliance notice must contain information describing
the nature of the material non-compliance with the technical specifications for the Service(s) in question. If Customer does not deliver
such a non-compliance notice within the two (2) business day period, Customer shall be deemed to have accepted the Service, and
billing will commence on the original Start of Service Date.
3. Service Cancellation. If a Service is cancelled prior to the Start of Service Date, Customer will pay to NITEL a charge equal to any
charges incurred by NITEL from the underlying service providers, in addition to any cancellation charges listed in the Service Guide.
4. Service Disconnection. In order to disconnect a Service, Customer must complete the NITEL Customer Disconnect Request Form
located at www.nitelusa.com/disconnects. Such termination is effective forty-five (45) days after NITEL's receipt of the notice, unless
otherwise agreed upon by Nitel and Customer.
5, Credit Review & Deposits. Provision of Services is subject to NITEL's credit approval of Customer. Based on the credit check, NITEL
may, in its sole discretion, require that Customer provide a deposit as a condition of purchasing Services. Additionally, during the Term,
if Customer fails to make timely payment for Services, NITEL may require adequate assurance of future payment (e.g., a deposit or other
acceptable form of security) as a condition of continuing NITELs Services. Customer's failure to provide adequate assurances required
by NITEL is a material breach of the Agreement..
6. Invoices and Disputes. Customer must pay all applicable Monthly Recurring Charges (MRCs) and Non-recurring Charges (NRCs)
set forth in the applicable Service Order or pricing attachment. Invoices are delivered monthly and payment is due 30 days after the
invoice date (the "Due Date). Fixed charges are billed in advance and usage-based charges are billed in arrears. Billing for partial
months is prorated. Past due amounts bear interest at 1.5% per month or the highest rate allowed by law, whichever is less (Late Fee).
Customer is responsible for all Service charges, even if incurred as the result of unauthorized use. If Customer reasonably disputes an
invoice, Customer must pay the undisputed amount by the Due Date and submit written notice of the disputed amount (detailing the
nature of the dispute, the Services and invoice(s) disputed). Customer must submit disputes in writing within sixty (60) days of the date
of the invoice or the right to dispute is waived. If a dispute is resolved against Customer, Customer will pay the disputed amounts within
ten (10) business days. Customer will be liable to NITEL for ail costs and expenses incurred in collecting amounts due to NITEL, including
reasonable legal fees.
