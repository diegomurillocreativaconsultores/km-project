Attention: Customer Care  
A. Monthly Fee, You will pay the monthly fee applicable to your Internet Service plan (the  Monthly Fee ) for the Internet Service . 
B. Minimum Service Commitment  and Early Termination Fee . Our Internet Service  plans  require you to commit to a 24 -month 
minimum service term ( Minimum Service Term ), unless a different term is expressly provided in the written terms of the Internet 
Service plan you select . If you upgrade from an Internet Service plan and the upgraded plan requires : (i) the use of upgraded 
Equipment (as de fined below) , or (ii) a service call to the Subscriber Premises (as defined below) , then you must  commit to a new 24 -
month Minimum Service Term beginning on the date we activate your new plan . If you terminate Internet Service  with us  prior to the 
expirati on of the then-applicable Minimum Service Term, you will owe (and your credit card, debit card, or bank account will 
promp tly be charged) the Termination Fee (as defined below ). The  Termination Fee  means an amount equal to the number of 
unpaid months left in your Minimum Service Term multiplied by $15.00.  For example, if you terminate Internet Service with 12 
unpaid months remaining on your Minimum Service Term, the Internet Service Termination Fee would equal $180.00.  
C. Term and Renewal . The term of this Agreement commences on the date we activate your Internet Service and continues for the 
duration of the Minimum Service Term unless terminated earlier by you or Viasat . After the Minimum Service Term expires, the term 
of this Agreement wil l automatically renew on a month -to-month basis, unless you have agreed to a new Minimum Service Term 
under another Internet Service plan offered by Viasat .  
D. Leased Equipment  and Installation . You must lease and install certain  equipment directly or indirectly provided by us to 
receive the Internet  Service . The equipment consists of a modem, a receiver , and ancillary customary mounting and installation 
materials  (collectively, and as may be replaced from time to time, the Leased Equipment ). The fee for the Leased Equipment (the 
Monthly Lease Fee) is set forth in your Internet Service plan, and, for some plans, may be included in the Monthly Fee.  Applicable 
taxes, surcharges , and fees will apply  to the Monthly Lease Fee . You agree to use only a Viasat  authorized installer  (a Designated 
Service Provider ) to install the Leased Equipment on your premises  (the  Subscriber Premises ). You will provide us with such 
location information (e.g., address, telephone number) that w e may request of each Subscriber Premises subject to this Agreement. We 
will charge  our standard one -time installation fee for a standard installation. Non -standard installations will be subject to additional 
charges above our standard installation fee. We  will communicate to you the amount of the installation fee prior to installation.  You 
agree to pay the installation fee on or prior to the date of installation . 
E.  Data Usage Limits for Internet Service Plans . Many of our Internet Service plans are  subject to data usage limits . We detail 
the data usage limits and how we calculate data usage in our Viasat Data Allowance Policy  â€“ Business Plans (the  Data Allowance 
Policy ). The Data Allowance Policy is part of this Agreement. If you exceed your data usage limit and (i) you subscribe to a plan 
other than any Business unlimited data plan or the Business 30 Internet Service plan , we will charge you for such additional usage at 
the additional usage rate identified for your Internet Service plan as set for th in Table 1 below, or (ii) you subscribe to the Business 30 
Internet Service plan, we will significantly slow and/or restrict your Internet Service, or certain uses of your Internet Ser vice, for the 
remainder of the applicable time period . Our current Internet Service plan menu , the data allowance limit , the additional usage rates  
and data usage threshold  for each plan are set forth in Table 1 and Table 2 below . Please note that not all Internet Service plans are 
available in all areas.

ï‚· Any Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract,  statute,

Leased Equipm ent, installation of the Leased Equipment or service calls ;

Rules ) of the American Arbitration Association ( AAA ), as modified by this Agreement, and will be a dministered by the AAA.  The 
Arbitration  Rules are available online at adr.org or  by calling the AAA at 1 -800-778-7879 . The arbitrator is bound b y the terms of this

Douglas, Denver, or Arapahoe County  in Colorado . During the arbitration, neither party shall disclose to the arbitrator the amount of 
any settlement offer made by either part y, until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to wh ich you or Viasat  is entitled. If 
your C laim is for $10 ,000 or less, you and Viasat  agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the

Arbitration  Rules. If your C laim exceeds $10 ,000, the right to a heari ng shall  be determined by the Arbitration  Rules.  Regardless of 
the manne r in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient ly explain ing the 
essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.  If the arbitrator finds t hat either the substance of a partys  Claim or the 
relief sought by a Claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of 
Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees related to the arbitration shall  be governed by the A rbitration  Rules. In such case, 
you agree to reimburse Viasat  for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your  obligation to pay under the Arbitration  
Rules.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the in dividual party seeking relief and only to the 
extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that partys individual Claim. YOU AND VIASAT  AGREE THAT EACH MAY 
BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A 
PLAINTIFF O R CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  Further more , 
the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one persons Claim, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representat ive or 
class proceeding, unless both you an d Viasa t otherwise agree in writing . Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the 
contrary, if Viasat  makes any f uture change to this Dispute Resolution  provision during your Minimum Service Term , you may reject
