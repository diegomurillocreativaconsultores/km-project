Service Attachment, in addition to any and all charges that are accrued but unpaid as of the termination date. 
15. Miscellaneous.
15.1 General. All provisions in the Agreement that by their nature are intended to survive expiration or termination will so survive. If 
any term of the Agreement is held unenforceable, the unenforceable term will be construed as nearly as possible to reflect the original 
intent of the parties, and the remaining terms will remain in effect. The Agreement is intended solely for CenturyLink and Customer and 
does not provide any third party with any right or benefit. 
15.2 Use of Name and Marks. Neither party will use the name or marks of the other party of any of its Affiliates for any purpose 
without the other partys prior written consent. CenturyLinks consent may only be given by its Legal Department.
15.3 Waiver. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Agreement, neither party's failure to insist upon strict performance of

trade practice will act to modify any provision of the Agreement.

employer-employee relationship, association, joint venture, partnership, or other form of legal entity or business enterprise between the

waives its right to a jury trial and any right to pursue any claim or action relating to the Agreement on a class or consolidated basis or in 
a representative capacity. If for any reason the jury trial waiver is held to be unenforceable, the parties agree to binding arbitration for 
any dispute relating to the Agreement under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et. seq. The arbitration will be conducted in 
accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules. Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in any court having

to comply with payment obligations) due to an event beyond a party's reasonable control ("Force Majeure Event"). If a Force Majeure 
Event prevents the provision of Service for a period of 30 days, either party may terminate the affected Service by providing 30 days 
written notice to the other party.

thereof: (a) in the event of a merger in which the party is not the surviving entity; (b) in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of its 
assets; or (c) to any Affiliate of such party; except that Customer may not assign this Agreement or any Service to a reseller or a

standing and creditworthiness equal to or better than Customer's, as reasonably determined by CenturyLink, through a generally 
accepted, third party credit rating index (i.e. D&B, S&P, etc.).
15.8 Amendments. Except as otherwise set forth the Agreement, all amendments to the Agreement will be in writing and signed by 
the parties' authorized representatives. Other oral or written communications between the parties, including emails, purporting to amend 
the Agreement will not be considered an amendment to the Agreement and are null and void.

Monthly Revenue Commitment Addendum
NSP #: 309813
Contract Code: 190013
CONFIDENTIAL© CenturyLink. All Rights Reserved.
U-CTA 0301171. General. This Addendum modifies the CenturyLink Total Advantage Agreement to add a Revenue Commitment. 
2.Section 1 of the Agreement is modified to add the following: 
1.1 Term; Commitment. The Revenue Commitment and Initial Term of the Agreement are $2,000/month; 3 years. 
The Initial Term begins on the Effective Date. At the end of the Initial Term, the Agreement will automatically renew on a 
month-to-month basis (a Renewal Term) unless one party provides written notice to the other party of its intention not to 
renew the Agreement at least 60 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term, or at least 30 days prior to the expiration of any 
Renewal Term. The Initial Term and each Renewal Term are referred to as the Term. The Order Term or Service Term for a 
particular Service is defined in the applicable Service Attachment. CenturyLink will not accept new orders after expiration or 
termination of the Agreement, but the Agreement will continue to apply to any unexpired orders or SOWs properly placed 
during the Term.
1.2. Contributory Charges. Customer is not obligated to order any particular Service; however, starting three months 
after the Effective Date, Customers aggregate Contributory Charges must equal or exceed the Revenue Commitment during 
each Measurement Period. Customer authorizes CenturyLink, its Affiliates, or its agents to use billing information to measure 
Customers Revenue Commitment. If Customer fails to meet its Revenue Commitment, Customer must pay CenturyLink a 
Shortfall charge.
3.Section 3 of the Agreement is deleted and replaced with the following: 
3. Rates. Services will receive the applicable rates specified in a Service Attachment for the duration of the Initial Term. 
Following expiration of the Initial Term, Customer will continue to receive the same rates for 90 days and then CenturyLink 
may change rates for Services to its then-current month-to-month or standard rates at any time after the initial 90 days 
following the expiration of the Initial Term. The Revenue Commitment does not apply during a Renewal Term. The rates set 
forth in the Service Attachment are in lieu of all other rates, discounts, or promotions.
4.Section 9.2 of the CenturyLink Communications, LLC Service Appendix is deleted and replaced with the following: 
9.2 Service Appendix. If this Service Appendix and all of the Services provided under it are terminated by Customer for 
any reason other than for Cause or by CenturyLink for Cause prior to the conclusion of the Initial Term, then Customer will pay 
the higher of: (a) the Early Termination Charge or (b) the total Cancellation Charges that apply for terminating all Services at 
the time all of the Services are terminated. Cause to terminate an individual Service Exhibit will not constitute Cause to 
terminate this Service Appendix. Rather, Cause to terminate the entire Service Appendix for Service-related claims will exist 
only if Customer has Cause to terminate all or substantially all of the Services under the applicable SLA, Service Exhibit, RSS 
or Tariff. Standard Cancellation Charges for individual Services will still apply if the Agreement is terminated during a Renewal 
Term.
5.Section 18 of the CCLLC Service Appendix is revised to add the following definitions:

Commitment for any other Annual Period(s) remaining in the Initial Term.

includes configuration and management of complex routing, switching, device NIC cards, firewall module configurations, and basic 
router internal firewall functions. CenturyLink acts as the Customers single point of contact in managing the resolution of all service, 
device, and transport faults covered by Comprehensive Management and will work with any third party hardware and/or transport 
providers the Customer has under contract until all network issues are successfully resolved. With Internet security protocol (IPSec), 
CenturyLink can configure full mesh, partial mesh, or hub-and-spoke topologies with secure tunnels for remote communication between 
Customer locations. IPSec is only available on approved Cisco and Adtran devices. IPSec opportunities greater than 25 devices or with 
other manufacturers devices require CenturyLink approval before submitting an order.  
(d) CenturyLink Responsibilities.  For NMS, CenturyLink will provide Customer with a nonexclusive service engineer team, 
which will maintain a Customer profile for the portion of the Customers network where the devices covered by NMS reside.  
CenturyLink will work with Customer to facilitate resolution of service affecting issues with Select Management or Comprehensive 
Management.
(e) Customer Responsibilities.
(i)Customer must provide all information and perform all actions reasonably requested by CenturyLink in order to facilitate 
installation of NMS.  If Customer limits or restricts CenturyLinks read/write access to a device, CenturyLink cannot support 
configuration backups.  Customer is responsible for supporting CenturyLink in access, troubleshooting, and configuration requests 
made in accordance with normal troubleshooting and repair support activities. For Out-of-Band management related to fault 
isolation/resolution, Customer will provide and maintain a POTS line for each managed device.  Out-of-Band means a connection 
between two devices that relies on a non-standard network connection, such as an analog dial modem, which must be a CenturyLink 
certified 56k external modem.  Additionally, Customer will provide a dedicated modem for each managed device.  It is not mandatory 
that Customer have a POTS line but Customer must understand that CenturyLink will not be able to troubleshoot issues if the device 
covered by NMS cannot be reached.  Service related outages requiring access to the device for troubleshooting and repair purposes 
will impact the eligibility of any associated SLA credits.
(ii)For Comprehensive Management, Customer must execute the attached Letter of Agency (Attachment 1) to authorize 
CenturyLink to act as Customers agent solely for the purpose of accessing Customers transport services.
(iii)Depending on transport type, Customers managed devices must comply with the following set of access requirements: (A) for 
NMS delivered via IP connectivity with an Internet Port or other public Internet service, devices must contain an appropriate version of 
OS capable of establishing IPsec VPNs; and (B) for NMS delivered with a Private Port, CenturyLink will configure a virtual circuit to 
access Customers device at no additional charge.  CenturyLink will add the NMS network operations center to the Customer closed 
user group to manage the devices within Customers network.
(iv)Customer must provide a routable valid IP address to establish the NMS connection.  Customers primary technical interface 
person must be available during the remote installation process to facilitate installation of NMS.  All Customer devices managed under 
NMS must be maintained under a contract from a CenturyLink approved onsite CPE maintenance provider.  The response times for 
which Customer contracts with its CPE maintenance provider will affect CenturyLinks timing for resolution of problems involving 
Customer provided devices.  The performance of the CPE maintenance provider is Customers responsibility.
(v)Customer may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or apply any other process or procedure to alter any CPE, 
software, or other component of this Service for any purpose. 
2.4 End-to-End Performance Reporting.  End-to-End Performance Reporting is a feature included with all Ports, except for 
Ports with VPLS. Customer must include CenturyLink as a member of each closed user group.  The feature includes a report based on 
data collected from Customers traffic within its closed user groups and measures availability, jitter, latency, and packet delivery 
between Customers edge routers, between CenturyLinks routers, and between Customers edge routers and CenturyLinks routers. 
The data contained in the report is measured differently than the goals contained in the SLA applicable to the Service and is for 
informational purposes only.  Customer is not entitled to SLA credits based on the data in the report.  Customer may access the report 
in the Control Center portal. Some quote forms or other associated documents may use End-to-End Performance Monitoring to mean 
End-to-End Performance Reporting.
2.5 Multicast.  Multicast is an optional feature for Private Ports.  The feature enables IP multicast on the CenturyLink IP network.  
Customer must configure its edge devices with CenturyLink designated multicast protocol specifications and use the CenturyLink

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CENTURYLINK IQ® NETWORKING SERVICE EXHIBIT
NSP #: 309813 Page 12 © CenturyLink. All Rights Reserved.
Contract Code: 190013CONFIDENTIALv1.1212162.7 VPN Extensions. A VPN Extension is an optional feature for layer 3 multi protocol label switching (MPLS) Private Ports.  
The feature allows Customer to extend its Layer 3 MPLS closed user groups to Customer locations that are not served by 
CenturyLinks MPLS network (Remote Location).  Customer can establish a tunnel through the Internet between the Customers CPE 
at the Remote Location (separately purchased and managed by Customer) and the CenturyLink network device. The Customer 
provided CPE must support the CenturyLink service configurations and be installed as designated by CenturyLink or as otherwise 
agreed upon by the parties.  Customer is responsible for the installation, operation, maintenance, use and compatibility of the Remote 
Location CPE. Customer will cooperate with CenturyLink in setting the initial configuration for the Remote Location CPE interface with 
the VPN Extension Service.  Customer must use IP connectivity at the Remote Location that includes a static public IP address. 
(a) Exclusions.  CenturyLink will not debug problems on, or configure any internal or external hosts or networks (e.g., routers, 
DNS servers, mail servers, www servers, and FTP servers).  All communication regarding the VPN Extension must be between 
CenturyLink and a Customer approved site contact that has relevant experience and expertise in Customers network operations.  The 
following features are not available with VPN Extensions: (i) End-to-End Performance Reporting; (ii) QoS; (iii) VPLS; and (iv) Multicast. 
VPN Extensions are not subject to the SLA.  
2.8 Backbone Prioritization/Priority Queuing.  Backbone Prioritization and Priority Queuing is an optional feature available with 
individual domestic Private Ports, CenturyLink IQ+ Ports, and CenturyLink IQ+ Cloud Ports.  When this feature is configured on such 
Port, traffic originating from that Port will be designated at a higher class of service to the CenturyLink IP network than traffic originating 
from such Ports without the feature or Internet Ports.  If Customer desires the feature for traffic between two or more such Ports, the 
feature must be ordered for each such Port.  The benefit from this feature is realized during periods of high network congestion. The 
feature may not be available at all locations or with Multicast in certain circumstances.
3. Ordering.  For purposes of this Service Exhibit, Order Form means an electronic order confirmation process using an 
architecture confirmation document (ACD) or other document that Customer and CenturyLink mutually agree to prior to submitting a 
Service order request.  CenturyLink must approve each Order Form and Customer must send it via e-mail, fax, or other CenturyLink-
approved electronic process to CenturyLink. Subject to availability, CenturyLink will assign /29 Internet address space for Customer 
during the use of a Port.  Neither Customer nor any End Users will own or route these addresses.  Upon termination of Service, 
Customers access to the IP addresses will cease. If Customer requests special sequencing for Port installation, Customer must 
designate a Key Port.  A Key Port is a Port that must be available on the network before adding additional domestic Port locations. 
The installation of the Key Port will determine the timelines for the installation of other domestic Ports. Customer may designate one 
Key Port within its CenturyLink IQ Networking network topology by notifying CenturyLink in writing of that request.  Unless the parties 
otherwise agree in writing, Customer has sole responsibility for ordering, securing installation and ensuring proper operation of any and 
all equipment required to enable Customer to receive the Service.
4. Charges.  Customer must pay all applicable MRCs and NRCs set forth in an attached pricing attachment, offer attachment, or 
a valid signed CenturyLink issued quote.  Charges will commence within five days after the date CenturyLink notifies Customer that 
Service is provisioned and ready for use (Start of Service Date). Customer may order multiple Ports with multiple pricing 
methodologies in accordance with the pricing methodologies set forth below.  Customer may change the pricing methodology (e.g., 
from Flat Rate to Precise Burstable) of a Port if: (a) the Ports new MRC remains the same or greater than the old MRC, and (b) the 
Port starts a new Service Term that is equal to or greater than the remaining number of months in the old Service Term, subject to a 12 
month minimum.  CenturyLink may change rates after the completion of a Ports Service Term with 60 days notice. The net rate MRCs 
set forth in the pricing attachment, offer attachment or valid signed CenturyLink issued quote will be used to calculate Contributory 
Charges.  Net rate MRCs are lieu of all other rates, discounts, and promotions. The End to End Performance Reporting, VPN 
Extension, SIG and Multicast features are provided on a month-to-month basis and either party may cancel a feature with 30 days prior 
written notice to the other party. CenturyLink may upon 30 days prior written notice to Customer modify those features, including 
without limitation, their rates. If a CenturyLink IQ+ Port uses Data Center Access as the access type, that Port will be understood to be a 
CenturyLink IQ+ Cloud Port.
4.1 Pricing Methodologies.  
(a) Flat Rate.  The Flat Rate pricing methodology bills Customer a specified MRC for a given Port speed regardless of 
Customers actual bandwidth utilization. 
(b) Tiered.  The Tiered pricing methodology caps Customers bandwidth at the tier specified on an Order Form and bills the 
Customer a fixed MRC based on that bandwidth tier regardless of Customers actual bandwidth utilization.  No more than once per 
month, Customer may change its specific bandwidth tier (e.g., 2 Mbps to10 Mbps) within the applicable Port classification (e.g., 
Ethernet, Fast Ethernet). Customer may not change its bandwidth from one Port classification to another. 
(c) Precise Burstable.  Usage samples are taken every five minutes throughout the monthly billing cycle.  Only one sample is 
captured for each five-minute period, even though there are actually two samples taken; one for inbound utilization and one for 
outbound utilization. The higher of these two figures is retained.  At the end of the billing period, the samples are ordered from highest 
to lowest.  The top 5% of the samples are discarded. The highest remaining sample is used to calculate the usage level, which is the 
95th percentile of peak usage. For each Precise Burstable Port, Customer will pay an MRC calculated by multiplying Customers 95th 
percentile of peak usage in a given month by the applicable MRC per Mbps.  There is a minimum usage amount within each Precise 
Burstable Port classification (Precise Burstable Minimum). Customer will be billed the greater of the Precise Burstable Minimum or the 
actual charges based upon its 95th percentile of peak usage. 
CENTURYLINK® TOTAL ADVANTAGE® AGREEMENT
DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CENTURYLINK IQ® NETWORKING SERVICE EXHIBIT
NSP #: 309813 Page 13 © CenturyLink. All Rights Reserved.
Contract Code: 190013CONFIDENTIALv1.121216(d) Data Transfer.  Usage samples are taken every five minutes throughout the Customers monthly billing cycle.  Samples are 
taken for both in-bound utilization and out-bound utilization.  Customer will be billed for the sum total of both inbound and outbound 
utilization.  Charges are applied using a stepped or metered methodology such that Customers traffic will be billed incrementally at 
each volume tier.  For example, if Customers total volume on a DS1 circuit is 10 GB, the first 7 GB of such total would be billed at the 
0-7 GB tier, and the remaining 3 GB would be billed at the 7.01-17 GB tier. For each Data Transfer Port ordered hereunder, Customer 
will pay an MRC calculated by multiplying Customers volume of data transferred in a given month (in GBs) by the applicable MRC per 
GB.  Within each Data Transfer Port classification (e.g., DS1, DS3), Customer will be subject to the minimum usage amount set forth in 
the column heading of the applicable Data Transfer pricing table (Data Transfer Minimum).  Customer will be billed the greater of the 
Data Transfer Minimum or the actual charges based upon its actual volume of data transferred.  Data Transfer pricing is only available 
if Customers premises-based router uses HDLC, PPP, or MLPPP line encapsulation.
5. Term; Cancellation.
5.1 Term. The term of an individual Port (and associated features/Services, if applicable) begins on the Start of Service Date for 
that Port and continues for (a) the service term shown on the valid signed CenturyLink issued quote or the pricing attachment or (b), if a 
service term is not shown in a quote or pricing attachment, three years. If Service is installed at multiple Customer locations or with 
multiple Ports at a Customer location, each separate Port (and associated features/Services) will have its own Start of Service Date.  
Upon expiration of a Service Term, individual domestic Ports (and associated features/Services) will remain in effect on a month-to-
month basis until canceled by either party with 60 days notice and international Ports will automatically renew for consecutive one year 
terms unless canceled by either party with 60 days notice prior to the end of the Port term.  
5.2 Cancellation.  Upon cancellation of a Service, Customer will remain liable for charges accrued but unpaid as of the 
cancellation date.  If a Port and associated features/Services is canceled by Customer other than for Cause, or by CenturyLink for 
Cause, before the conclusion of its Service Term or Upgrade Service Term (as described in the Upgrades section), Customer will pay 
a Cancellation Charge equal to: 
(a)Domestic Internet Ports or Private Ports: (i) 100% of the Port and NMS MRCs multiplied by the number of months remaining in 
the first 12 months of the initial Service Term (or Upgrade Service Term), if any, plus (ii) 35% of the balance of those MRCs multiplied 
by the number of months remaining to complete the initial Service Term (or Upgrade Service Term) beyond the first 12 months, plus (iii) 
the amount of any NRCs discounted or waived if the Port has not remained installed for at least 12 months.
(b) Domestic and international CenturyLink IQ+ Ports and CenturyLink IQ+ Cloud Ports: (i) 100% of the CenturyLink IQ+ Port or 
CenturyLink IQ+ Cloud Port MRC (and associated features/Service MRCs if applicable) multiplied by the number of months remaining 
in the first 12 months of the initial Service Term, if any; plus (ii) 75% of the those MRCs multiplied by the number of months remaining 
to complete 24 months of the initial Service Term, if any; plus, if applicable, (iii) 50% of those MRCs multiplied by the number of months 
remaining to complete the remainder of the Service Term. 
(c)International Internet Ports or Private Ports: (i) 100% of the Port, local access and NMS MRCs multiplied by the number of 
months remaining in the Service Term. If Customer cancels the Service Exhibit or an international Internet Port, or Private Port before 
the completion of a renewal period for reasons other than for Cause, then Customer will pay a Cancellation Charge equal to the amount 
of any applicable termination related charges incurred by CenturyLink from any third party provider. 
(d)All international Ports:  If Customer cancels an international order for which Customer accepted special construction or other 
site preparation charges before its Start of Service Date or at any time during a Port Service Term, then Customer will pay (i) the 
special construction or site preparation charges, and (ii) any additional CenturyLink-incurred cost to provide the Service. But if 
CenturyLink notifies Customer that special construction is required to provision Service and Customer cancels Service on that particular 
order because Customer does not approve such construction, CenturyLink will not charge a Cancellation Charge for canceling Service 
on that particular order unless CenturyLink incurs a charge from the underlying local access provider despite the cancellation.  
5.3 Waiver of Cancellation Charges. 
(a) Upgrades. CenturyLink will waive the Cancellation Charges for a domestic Port if Customer: (i) upgrades a Port to another 
Port with a higher bandwidth (e.g., from a DS1 to a DS3) within the same pricing methodology and the new Ports MRC (with Local 
Access) is equal to or greater than the combined MRCs of the Port and the associated Local Access Service being terminated; or (ii) 
upgrades the Port type to a higher Port type (e.g., from an Internet Port to a Private Port or CenturyLink IQ + Port ) within the same 
pricing methodology.  All upgraded Ports must start a new Service Term equal to or greater than the replaced Ports remaining Service 
Term, subject to a 12 month minimum (Upgrade Service Term).  If Customer cancels the upgraded Port before the completion of the 
Upgrade Service Term, Customer will pay the Cancellation Charges set forth in the Cancellation section above.  In some cases an 
upgrade to a Port may trigger a Local Access charge under the Local Access Service Exhibit.  Customer can upgrade a CenturyLink 
IQ+ Port from 8x5 NBD Remote to 24x7 On-Site maintenance or upgrade a CenturyLink IQ+ Ports NMS feature to Select Management 
or Comprehensive Management without restarting the Service Term.
(b) Migration to Other CenturyLink Services.  CenturyLink will waive the Cancellation Charges for a domestic Port if Customer 
migrates the Port to a new Data Bundle solution (a New Service) as long as: (i) the New Services MRC is equal to or greater than the

v1.1014161. General.  CenturyLink QCC will provide Local Access Service ("Service") under the terms of this Service Exhibit, the Agreement 
and the RSS.  
2. Service Description and Availability.
2.1 Description.  Service provides the physical connection between the Service Address and the CenturyLink Domestic Network.  
Service includes any entrance cable or drop wire to, and equipment maintained by CenturyLink at the Demarcation Point, but does not 
include CPE, Extended Wiring, inside wiring, or other equipment not maintained by CenturyLink.  Customer is responsible for any 
additional terminations beyond the Demarcation Point.  All equipment owned by CenturyLink remains property of CenturyLink.  
Customer disclaims any interest in any equipment, property or licenses used by CenturyLink to provide Service.  CenturyLink will not 
provide Service to a residential location, even if business is conducted at that location.  Service is not a standalone service and 
Customer must purchase the Service in connection with another CenturyLink service for which a local loop is required.  
2.2 Types of Service Technologies.  CenturyLink uses the following different technologies to provide Service.  Some technologies 
or speeds may not be available in all areas or with certain types of Service.
(a) Special Access.  Special Access means Service using digital signal bandwidths DS0, DS1 and DS3 or Optical Carrier signal 
bandwidths OC3, OC12, OC48 and OC192. 
(b) Ethernet Local Access (ELA).  ELA is available at bandwidths varying from 1 Mbps to 1,000 Mbps (1G) and 10G (Cross-
Connect Access only).  ELA is available in the following options: Native Single-Class-of-Service (CoS) Low, Native Single-CoS Medium, 
Native Single-CoS High, Native Multi-CoS, ELA over SONET, or Ethernet Virtual Access (EVA).  Native Single-CoS Low is a layer 2, 
switched, native service using a standard Ethernet offering from the local access provider.  Native Single-CoS Low is not recommended 
for use with critical applications (i.e. voice), but is ideal for non-critical applications (i.e. Internet and email traffic.)  Native Single-CoS 
Medium is a layer 2, switched, native service using a better-than-standard Ethernet offering from the local access provider.  Native 
Single-CoS Medium is ideal for a combination of non-critical and/or critical applications; typically varying voice, video, and data.  Native 
Single-CoS High is a layer 2, switched, native service using the best Ethernet offering from the local access provider.  Native Single-
CoS High is ideal for critical applications; typically predictable and reliable voice and data.  Native Single-CoS Medium and Native 
Single-CoS High are only available with the following CenturyLink services:  CenturyLink IQ® Networking Internet Port, Private Port or 
Enhanced Port with Secure Internet Gateway, E-Line, or Ethernet Private Line (EPL).  Native Single-CoS Medium or Native Single-
CoS High circuit speed must match the maximum CenturyLink IQ Networking port, E-Line, or EPL bandwidth.  Native Multi-CoS is a 
layer 2, switched, native service closely aligning the CenturyLink IQ Networking QoS and the local access providers Ethernet class of 
service offering and is only available with CenturyLink IQ Networking Private Port or Enhanced Port with Secure Internet Gateway.  At 
Customers discretion, Native Single-CoS Low, Native Single-CoS Medium, Native Single-CoS High, or Native Multi-CoS may be used 
to support CoS for critical applications (i.e. voice).  ELA over SONET is a layer 1, SONET-based service.  EVA is a layer 2, Ethernet-
based service that provides customers with a premium non-oversubscribed connection with Fast E and Gig E connection types.  
Customer may experience delayed installation intervals due to construction requirements and available bandwidths may be limited due 
to distance and available Ethernet-supported facilities from the local access provider.
(c) Wavelength Local Access.  Wavelength Local Access means Service using wave division multiplexing technology.  
Wavelength Local Access is available at bandwidths of 1 GbE, 10 GbE LAN PHY, 2.5 G (OC48), 10 GbE WAN PHY (OC192), 40G, 
OTU1,  OTU2,  OTU3, 1G, 2G, 4G and 10G. 
(d) DSL Local Access.  DSL Local Access means Leased Access using digital subscriber line (DSL) technology.  DSL Local 
Access is available at bandwidths varying from 128 kbps/64 kbps to 15000 Mbps/1000 Mbps.  Customer may experience delayed 
installation intervals due to Construction requirements and available bandwidths may be limited due to distance and available DSL-
supported facilities from the local access provider.
2.2.1 Use of IP Connection.  In some locations, CenturyLink will enable the Local Access component of your service using IP 
Connection which is a Layer 3, symmetrical functionality that utilizes established IP and MPLS transport technologies.  In such cases, 
Customer agrees that it will use IP Connection functionality only for the provision of either: (i) wireline broadband Internet access (as 
defined in applicable Federal Communications Commission orders and regulations), or (ii) wireline broadband Internet access plus 
additional information services, with wireline broadband Internet access constituting a principal use.  CenturyLink can provision IP 
Connection functionality over multiple designs with MPLS transport supporting speeds up to 1G/1G.
2.3 Types of Service.  CenturyLink offers the following three types of Service:  CenturyLink Provided Access, Customer Provided 
Access or Cross-Connect Access. 
2.3.1 CenturyLink Provided Access.  CenturyLink Provided Access or CLPA means either On-Net Access or Leased Access.  
(a) On-Net Access.  For On-Net Access, Customer must be located in a CenturyLink designated building in which On-Net Access is 
generally available.  On-Net Access is generally available as Special Access (except at the DS0 bandwidth), ELA, and Wavelength 
Local Access.  Depending on the Service Address, On-Net Access may be provided through an existing CPOP, newly built CPOP, 
existing intra-building local loop facilities, or connections to a third party provider where CenturyLink coordinates the connectivity 
between CenturyLink facilities and facilities of a service provider with whom CenturyLink is interconnected. On-Net Access is subject to 
the On-Net Service Level Agreement located at http://www.centurylink.com/legal/, which is subject to change.
(b) Leased Access.  Leased Access is generally available as Special Access, ELA, Wavelength Local Access, and DSL Local 
Access at the bandwidths described in this Service Exhibit for those access types.  Customer may request a Preferred Provider for 
CENTURYLINK® TOTAL ADVANTAGE® AGREEMENT 
LOCAL ACCESS SERVICE EXHIBIT
NSP #: 309813
Contract Code: 190013
CONFIDENTIAL© CenturyLink.  All Rights Reserved.
v1.101416Leased Access from a list of available providers with whom CenturyLink has interconnect agreements.  CenturyLink will attempt to use 
Customers Preferred Provider, but both final routing and the provider actually used will be chosen by CenturyLink.  Where available for 
Special Access, ELA and Wavelength Local Access, Customer may request CenturyLink to provide a separate fiber facility path for a 
protection system between the local access providers serving wire center and the Service Address (Protect Route).  Protect Route 
uses backup electronics and two physically separate facility paths in the provisioning of Service.  If the working facility or electronics fail, 
or the Service performance becomes impaired, the facility is designed to automatically switch to the Service protect path in order to 
maintain a near-continuous flow of information between locations.  Special Access and ELA are also generally available as a central 
office meet point at a local access provider central office to which Customer has a dedicated connection.  
2.3.2 Customer Provided Access.  Customer Provided Access or CPA means a local loop that Customer orders from a local 
access provider to connect Customers premises to the CenturyLink Domestic Network at a connection point specified by CenturyLink.  
CenturyLink will provide Customer with a limited letter of agency (LOA), which is incorporated by this reference, authorizing Customer 
to act as CenturyLinks agent so that Customers local access provider will connect Customers premises to the CenturyLink Domestic 
Network.  Customer will also need to execute a CPA-DAR Addendum for CPA POP with ELA or Wavelength Local Access.  Customer 
will pay a CPA charge to CenturyLink when Customer uses the following: (a) Special Access CPA dedicated facilities or ELA CPA 
virtual local area network (VLAN), both of which are dedicated entrance facilities CenturyLink leases from a local access provider and 
that carry traffic only from CenturyLink; or (b) ELA CPA POP, which requires CenturyLink to provide space and power for the local 
access provider to install Ethernet equipment; or (c) Wavelength Local Access.  Customer will pay a CPA charge to CenturyLink when 
Customer uses Special Access CPA non-dedicated facilities owned by local access providers and that carry traffic from multiple 
carriers, including CenturyLink, if the provider charges CenturyLink for those facilities.  CPA ELA VLAN is an access type where 
CenturyLink will provision and assign an Ethernet virtual circuit from a CenturyLink POP to a Customer designated Ethernet facility 
leased from a common Ethernet service provider.  This access will be used to connect to a CenturyLink VLAN assignment on a 
CenturyLink IQ Networking Internet or Private Port or E-Line.  CenturyLink will not bill customer a CPA charge for an IP layer 3 
expansion site because Customer, not CenturyLink, is responsible for ordering a cross-connect from the IP layer 3 expansion site 
manager to meet CenturyLink in the IP layer 3 expansion sites meet-me-room.  CPA is the responsibility of Customer and CenturyLink 
will not pay for or troubleshoot components of CPA.  
2.3.3 Cross-Connect Access.  Cross-Connect Access or XCA means: (a) an intra-POP connection between certain Customer 
facilities with direct access to the CenturyLink Domestic Network and the CenturyLink backbone access point (either (i) located within 
CenturyLink's transport area where CenturyLink allows Customer to bring its own fiber directly to the CenturyLink fiber under an 
executed Direct Connect Agreement (Direct Connect) or (ii) in an area where Customer has leased space in a CPOP, a remote 
collocation site, or a collocation hotel under a Telecommunications Collocation License Agreement or (b) a connection between a 
CenturyLink-determined data center and a CenturyLink IQ Networking Port, Optical Wavelength Service (OWS), or E-Line (Data 
Center Access) under an executed CenturyLink TS Service Exhibit with a CenturyLink IQ Networking, OWS or E-Line Service Exhibit.  
Data Center Access is available in bandwidths of 100 Mbps, 1G, and 10G (CenturyLink IQ Networking and OWS only).  Direct Connect 
requires splicing of Customer and CenturyLink fibers and cross-connection of individual circuits. 
2.4 RSS.  Customer understands that Service is an interstate telecommunications service, as defined by Federal Communications 
Commission regulations and represents while using the Service, more than 10% of its usage will be interstate usage.
3. Ordering.  Upon acceptance of an order for a Service, CenturyLink will notify Customer of CenturyLinks target date for the 
delivery of that Service (Estimated Availability Date).  Once CenturyLink notifies Customer of the Estimated Availability Date for a 
Service, cancellation fees or Cancellation Charges set forth in the Cancellation section below will apply to any cancellation of that order.  If 
Customer fails to respond to CenturyLinks requests to arrange for the installation of a Service when CenturyLink is ready, CenturyLink 
may consider the affected Service order canceled.  CenturyLink will use commercially reasonable efforts to install each such Service on or 
before the Estimated Availability Date, but the inability of CenturyLink to deliver Service by such date is not a default under the Agreement 
or this Service Exhibit.  
4. Charges.  Customer will pay the rates set forth in a quote for Service issued by CenturyLink or set forth in the RSS, including all 
applicable ancillary service charges.  CenturyLink invoices MRCs in advance and NRCs in arrears.  If the Start of Service Date for any 
Service falls on any day other than the first day of the month, the first invoice to Customer will consist of:  (a) the pro-rata portion of the 
applicable MRC covering the period from the Start of Service Date to the first day of the subsequent month; and (b) the MRC for the 
following month.  Charges for Service will not be used to calculate Contributory Charges.
4.1 Ancillary Charges.  Ancillary charges applicable to Service include but are not limited to those ancillary services set forth in this 
section.  If an ancillary charge applies in connection with provisioning a particular Service, CenturyLink will notify Customer of the 
ancillary charge to be billed to Customer.  Customer may either approve or disapprove CenturyLink providing the ancillary service.  
(a) Expedite.  A local loop expedite charge applies to orders where Customer requests the delivery of Service one or more days 
before the Estimated Availability Date.  Customer may only request to expedite CenturyLink Provided Access of Special Access and 
ELA orders (where underlying local access provider allows CenturyLink QCC to order an expedited service.)
(b) Extended Wiring.  Extended Wiring means additional wiring required for orders where Customers network interface 
equipment is not located in the same location as the Demarcation Point.  Customer may only request Extended Wiring for (i) Special 
Access ordered as Leased Access, (ii) DSL Local Access, and (iii) Ethernet Local Access (where available).
(c) Construction.  Construction charges apply if; (i) special construction is required to extend Service to the Demarcation Point; or 
(ii) other activities not covered by Extended Wiring are required beyond the Demarcation Point, that cause CenturyLink to incur 
CENTURYLINK® TOTAL ADVANTAGE® AGREEMENT

v1.101416additional expenses for provisioning the Service (e.g., special arrangements to provide conduit or intra-building cable) (Construction).  
If Customer does not approve of the Construction charges after CenturyLink notifies Customer of the charges, the Service ordered will 
be deemed cancelled.  
(d) Multiplexing.  Customer may request multiplexing for Special Access where available.  CenturyLink will multiplex lower level 
local loop into a higher local loop, or vice-versa, for an additional charge.  CenturyLink offers multiplexing at a CPOP, at an On-Net 
Access building or at an ILEC/CLEC facility providing the Leased Access.  For multiplexing at a CenturyLink On-Net Access building, 
CenturyLink provides multiplexed circuit handoffs to Customer at the same On-Net Access Service Address.  For multiplexing at 
ILEC/CLEC facility, CenturyLink facilitates the delivery of multiplexed circuit handoffs to Customer at a single Service Address or at 
multiple Service Addresses per Customers request.  Multiplexing is generally available at DS1 and OCn circuit levels.  Pricing for 
multiplexing at an ILEC/CLEC facility is on an individual case basis.
(e) Changes.  Ancillary change charge applies where Customer requests CenturyLink to change a local loop to a different Service 
Address that is within the same Customer serving wire center as the existing local loop, but a Cancellation Charge does not apply.
5. Term; Cancellation.  
5.1 Term.  The term of an individual Service begins on the Start of Service Date for that Service and continues for the number of 
months specified in the quote for Service issued by CenturyLink (Initial Service Term).  Excluding voice loops and Data Center Access 
with a month-to-month Initial Service Term, the Initial Service Term will not be less than 12 months.  Upon expiration of the Initial 
Service Term, Service will automatically renew for consecutive periods equal to the Initial Service Term length (a Renewal Service 
Term).  CenturyLink may change rates at any time after the Initial Service Term, but will not change rates more than once during a 
Renewal Service Term.  
5.2 Cancellation.  Upon cancellation of a Service, Customer will remain liable for (a) charges accrued but unpaid as of the 
cancellation date (including MRCs, NRCs and Construction charges and other ancillary charges), (b) the amount of any NRCs that 
CenturyLink discounted or waived, if canceled during the first 12 months of the Initial Service Term and (c) any applicable cancellation 
fees and Cancellation Charges as set forth below.  
(a) Leased Access and On-Net Access—Cancellation Before the Start of Service Date.  Customer will pay the cancellation fee 
identified in the below table if cancellation of a Service order occurs before the Start of Service Date.  If Customer accepted a 
Construction charge, Customer will also pay any unpaid Construction charges incurred by CenturyLink.  If CenturyLink notifies 
Customer that Construction is required to provision a Service order and Customer cancels that order before the Start of Service Date 
because Customer disapproves of the Construction charge, the cancellation fee does not apply.
Leased Access and On-Net Access Service Bandwidth† Before Start of Service Date Cancellation Fee
DS0 (Leased Access only), DS1, DSL Local Access speeds up to 
1536 Kbps/1.024 Mbps $150 NRC
DS3, OCn, DSL Local Access speeds greater than 1536 Kbps/1.024 
Mbps, all ELA speeds, all Wavelength Local Access speeds, all IP 
Connection speeds$500 NRC
†Includes all types of Service Technology unless otherwise noted. 
(b) All Service Types—Cancellation After the Start of Service Date.  If a Service is canceled by Customer other than for Cause, 
or by CenturyLink for Cause, before the conclusion of its Initial Service Term, Customer will pay a Cancellation Charge equal to:  
(i) 100% of the balance of the MRCs that otherwise would have become due for the unexpired portion of the first 12 months of the Initial 
Service Term, if any, plus (ii) 35% of the balance of the MRCs that otherwise would have become due for the unexpired portion, if any, 
of the Initial Service Term beyond the first 12 months.  
(c) Moves.  When Customer requests that CenturyLink move a local loop to a different Service Address that is not within the same 
Customer serving wire center as the existing local loop such move will be deemed a disconnect of the current local loop to which a 
Cancellation Charge applies and a new install of a new local loop.  
(d) Waiver of Cancellation Charges.  CenturyLink will waive the Cancellation Charge for a cancelled Service:
(i) When Customer cancels a Special Access ordered as Leased Access if it is (A) DS3 or less, (B) is not part of a bundle or 
package offering that required Customer to order the local loop with other service components and (C) the local loops Start of 
Service Date was at least 12 months prior to the requested date of cancellation. 
(ii) When Customer upgrades existing Special Access, Native Single-CoS Low/Medium/High, Native Multi-CoS, ELA over 
SONET, or Wavelength Local Access (Existing CLPA Service) with new Service within the same specific type of Service 
technology at a higher Service speed (e.g., Special Access DS1 to Special Access DS3 or Native Single-CoS Low Fast E to 
Native Single-CoS Low Gig E) and with the same local access provider (Upgraded CLPA Service).  The Upgraded CLPA 
Service will have a new Service Term beginning on its Start of Service Date.  If the type of Service technology changes when 
Customer upgrades Existing CLPA Service, Customer must pay Cancellation Charges.  
(e) Customer Provided Access—Cancellation of Connectivity after Start of Service Date.  To cancel CPA, Customer must 
provide CenturyLink with a written disconnect firm order confirmation (DFOC) notice from Customers CPA provider along with notice 
to cancel the CPA.  If Customer fails to provide CenturyLink with the DFOC notice within 30 calendar days after CenturyLinks receipt of 
the notice to cancel the CPA, or if CenturyLink disconnects CPA for Cause, then CenturyLink may disconnect the CPA or require the 
CENTURYLINK® TOTAL ADVANTAGE® AGREEMENT 
LOCAL ACCESS SERVICE EXHIBIT

v1.101416CPA provider to do so.  Customer will remain liable for charges for the connectivity to CPA (even if Customer cannot use the CPA) until: 
(i) Customer furnishes the required DFOC to CenturyLink; or (ii) either party cancels the associated CPA with the CPA provider.  
6. Grooming.  If CenturyLink plans to groom a circuit on which Service is provided, CenturyLink will provide a grooming notice to 
Customer.  For CPA dedicated facilities grooming, Customer will provide a signed LOA to CenturyLink so that CenturyLink can order 
the necessary changes.  Within 20 calendar days after receipt of that notice, Customer will:  (a) notify CenturyLink of its approval, which 
may not be unreasonably withheld; (b) state its reason for refusing; or (c) request that CenturyLink provide Customer with an LOA so 
Customer can order the necessary changes.  Customer's failure to respond within the 20-day period will constitute approval of the 
groom.  If the groom results in Customer incurring additional NRCs from its local access provider and Customer provides sufficient 
proof of the local access provider charge, CenturyLink will issue a credit to Customer equal to the local access provider NRC for each 
groomed circuit.  If Customer refuses the groom for On-Net Access, CenturyLink will, upon 20 calendar days prior written notice, cancel 
the Service on that circuit and assess a Cancellation Charge.  When Customer does not respond to a CPA dedicated facilities grooming 
notice or refuses a CPA dedicated facilities groom, Customer must either: (a) provide CenturyLink with a LOA/CFA so that CenturyLink 
can have the local access provider cancel the circuit; or (b) work directly with the local access provider to cancel the circuit.  If 
Customer does neither of these things, CenturyLink will pass through to Customer any costs incurred by CenturyLink from the local 
access provider as a result of the circuit remaining in place.  CFA means circuit facility assignment of the CenturyLink facility, as 
identified by CenturyLink, to which Customer must order a local loop for connection to the CenturyLink Domestic Network.
7. Definitions.  Capitalized terms not defined in this Service Exhibit are defined in the Agreement.
CenturyLink Domestic Network means the CenturyLink network located within the contiguous U.S. states and Hawaii, which is 
comprised only of physical media, including switches, circuits, and ports that are operated by CenturyLink.  
CPOP means a CenturyLink-owned physical point of presence that lies directly on the CenturyLink Domestic Network where direct 
interconnection between the CenturyLink Domestic Network and a local access providers network is possible.
Demarcation Point means the CenturyLink designated interface between the CenturyLink Domestic Network or the Leased Access 
provider network and Customers telecommunications equipment.  The Demarcation Point is typically located at a suitable location in 
the basement or on the first floor of a Service Address where provision is made for termination of the local access providers outside 
distribution network facilities.
Leased Access means local backbone access circuits ordered and leased by CenturyLink from a local access provider chosen by 
CenturyLink.
On-Net Access means local backbone access circuits provided solely on CenturyLink owned and operated facilities.
Preferred Provider or PP means a specific local access provider requested by Customer for Leased Access.
Service Address means the business building where Customer receives the Service.
Start of Service Date for each circuit is the date Customer accepts the circuit, following notification by CenturyLink that the local loop 
is ready.  The ready notification will be via phone call or e-mail.  Customer has five days from CenturyLinks ready notification in which 
to inform CenturyLink if the circuit fails to operate error-free.  Within the five-day timeframe, if Customer neither informs CenturyLink 
about errors nor accepts the circuit, the circuit will be considered to have been accepted and the Start of Service Date to have 
commenced on the fifth day following CenturyLinks ready notification, regardless of whether Customer placed traffic over the circuit.  If 
Customer informs CenturyLink of circuit errors within the five-day timeframe, CenturyLink will promptly take necessary, reasonable 
action to correct the errors, and upon correction, notify Customer that the circuit is ready.

v1.101416PRICING ATTACHMENT
Except as set forth in this Pricing Attachment, capitalized terms will have the definitions assigned to them in the Agreement or the Local 
Access Exhibit. 
1.  Customer will pay the MRCs and Install NRCs for the Local Access Service selected.  In addition, Customer will pay all MRCs or 
NRCs for any ancillary services provided as described in the Local Access Service Exhibit, including without limitation Construction 
charges. 
2.  Customer will pay the MRCs and NRCs for Service at the particular Service Address; or NPA/NXX or CLLI if no Service Address is 
provided, set forth in the table below.  The MRCs and NRCs set forth below apply to new Service only and do not apply to Service 
ordered prior to the effective date of this Pricing Attachment.  All MRCs and NRCs set forth in the below table apply per circuit and not 
per Service Address.  Any modifications to any attribute of the particular Service (i.e., the NPA/NXX or CLLI, Service Address, type of 
Local Access, Service term or circuit speed) will render the pricing below void, and Customer will pay the revised rates agreed upon by 
the parties for the particular Service at the Service Address or NPA/NXX or CLLI, as applicable.  If a DS1 is bonded with one or more 
DS1s to create a higher speed NxDS1 at the same Service Address, the MRC for the DS1 may be multiplied by the number of bonded 
DS1s to determine the MRC for the NxDS1.  The pricing contained in this Pricing Attachment represents pricing for the local access 
provider and route selected by CenturyLink.  Customer requests for a Preferred Provider or route may be subject to different pricing.

offerings (collectively, CPE) and CPE installation and maintenance (Service) under the terms set forth in the Agreement, this Service 
Exhibit and any Rental CPE Rate Attachment submitted hereunder.  Capitalized terms not defined herein are defined in the Agreement.  
Rental CPE Rate Attachment means the CenturyLink order request form issued and executed by CenturyLink and Customer.  CPE, 
as defined in this Service Exhibit, does not include CPE purchased by Customer.  In order to qualify for CPE, Customer must also 
purchase either CenturyLink IQ® Networking, SIP Trunk, Analog VoIP, Hosted VoIP, Managed Office, Managed Enterprise, Integrated

2. Delivery and Return.  CPE will be delivered to Customers location as identified, in writing, by Customer.  Delivery will be made 
either by F.O.B. origin, freight paid by Customer, or personal delivery by CenturyLink.  CPE will be installed as designated herein, or as 
otherwise agreed upon by the parties.  Except as otherwise provided in the Service Exhibit for the Underlying Service, upon termination 
of Service, or when Customer replaces CPE with upgraded models, Customer must return terminated or replaced CPE at its own 
expense within 15 calendar days of termination or replacement.  CenturyLink will provide Customer with return instructions.  Customer 
will deliver CPE to CenturyLink in the same condition it was on the Effective Date, normal wear and tear excepted, and give 
CenturyLink written notice of such return.  If CPE is not returned within 15 calendar days of termination, Customer will become owner of 
and bear all responsibility for the terminated or replaced CPE and CenturyLink may invoice Customer the then-current value of the 
applicable CPE model (Replacement Cost). 
3. Ownership and Use.  Except as provided in Paragraph 2, CPE is the personal property of CenturyLink, its designee or a third 
party provider, notwithstanding that the CPE, or any part thereof, may be affixed or attached to Customers real property or any 
improvements thereon.  Customer has no right or interest to the CPE other than as provided herein and will hold the CPE subject and 
subordinate to the rights of CenturyLink.  Customer will: (a) at its own expense, keep the CPE free and clear of any claims, liens, and 
encumbrances of any kind; and (b) make no alterations or affix any additions or attachments to the CPE, except as approved by 
CenturyLink in writing.  Customer will not remove, alter or destroy any labels on the CPE and will allow CenturyLink the inspection of 
the CPE at any time.  As between CenturyLink and Customer, Customer will bear the entire risk of loss, theft, casualty, destruction or 
damage to the CPE following delivery from any cause whatsoever (collectively, Loss), until returned to CenturyLink.  Customer will 
indemnify, defend and hold harmless CenturyLink its affiliates, and contractors for any such Loss.  Customer agrees to advise 
CenturyLink in writing within five business days of any such Loss.  In no event will such Loss relieve Customer of the obligation to pay 
CenturyLink any amounts due hereunder. 
4. Software.  Software licensor has retained title to the software.  To the extent possible, CenturyLink grants Customer a software 
license or sublicense in the software according to the licensing agreement accompanying such software, which extends only to 
Customer's own internal business use of such software and only on or with the designated CPE.  Software must be held in confidence 
and may not be reproduced unless specifically authorized by the software licensor.  Customer is prohibited from reverse engineering, 
decompiling or disassembling the CPE or otherwise attempting to derive the source code of the software.  All CPE is subject to the 
terms and conditions set forth in the manufacturers or publishers warranty or end-user license.
5. Insurance.  Without limiting the liabilities or indemnification obligations of Customer, Customer will, at its own cost and expense, 
maintain during the term of this Agreement, such insurance as required hereunder.  The insurance coverage will be from a company, or 
companies, with an A.M. Bests rating of A-VII and authorized to do business in each state where CPE is located.  Customer may

under this Agreement, Customer will make available to CenturyLink evidence of the insurance required herein.
6. Charges.  The charges for CPE and Service are set forth in the Rental CPE Rate Attachment, and will be used to calculate 
Contributory Charges.  Charges will commence within five days of CenturyLinks notification to Customer that the Underlying Service is 
provisioned and ready for use (Start of Service Date).  CenturyLink may cease providing Service and demand return of CPE if 
payment is not made when due.
7. CPE Replacement Recovery Charge.  Where CPE rented from CenturyLink is replaced due to loss or damage not covered by 
maintenance under the applicable Detailed Description (for example, damage from accident, misuse or abuse), Customer will pay:  (a) 
the Replacement Cost for the damaged CPE, and (b) a one-time charge to cover CenturyLinks cost to ship the new CPE.  If Customer 
requires on-site assistance from CenturyLink to install the replacement CPE, an additional dispatch charge will apply.  CenturyLink will 
quote the charges in advance, obtain Customers approval, and invoice the charges within 60 days.  Customer is responsible for any 
claim for reimbursement from its insurance carrier.  The terms and conditions in this Service Exhibit will continue to apply.

v1.1014168. Term.  This Service Exhibit will commence on the Effective Date of the Agreement (or, if applicable, an amendment to the 
Agreement if this Service Exhibit is added to the Agreement after its Effective Date), and will remain in effect until terminated.  Either 
party may terminate this Service Exhibit with at least 60 days prior written notice to the other party.  Termination will not affect 
obligations under Rental CPE Rate Attachments accepted prior to the effective date of termination, and this Service Exhibit will remain 
in effect as to such obligations if it would otherwise have terminated.  CPE and Service ordered during the Term will commence on the 
Start of Service Date and will continue for a number of months as set forth on the Rental CPE Rate Attachment (CPE Term).  Upon 
expiration of the CPE Term, CPE and Service will automatically renew on a month to month basis at the then current rates, unless 
either party elects to terminate the CPE and Service by providing 60 days prior written notice of such termination to the other party.  If 
the Agreement or any CPE and Service provided hereunder are terminated prior to the expiration of the applicable CPE Term for 
reasons other than by Customer for Cause, then Customer will pay to CenturyLink:  (a) all charges for CPE and Service provided 
through the effective date of such cancellation; and (b) an early cancellation charge of 100% of the balance of MRCs that otherwise 
would have become due for the unexpired portion of the CPE Term.  
9. Installation, Maintenance and Safety Compliance.  Installation, maintenance or other labor provided to Customer pursuant to 
this Agreement is subject to, and controlled by, Detailed Description(s) which are posted under CPE at

the Detailed Descriptions at any time and such change will be effective upon posting to the Web site.  Customer is responsible for 
informing CenturyLink of the existence, location and condition of any Hazardous Substances that may be in or around the CenturyLink 
work area.  "Hazardous Substance" means a substance regulated by any safety regulation and includes, without limitation, asbestos.  
Customer will indemnify and hold CenturyLink harmless from any fines or other liability of CenturyLink arising from Customer's failure to 
inform CenturyLink of hazardous substances. 
10. Additional Limitation of Liabilities.  If CPE contains a firewall or other security features, CenturyLink makes no warranty, 
guarantee, or representation, express or implied, that all security threats and vulnerabilities will be detected or that the performance of 
Service will render Customers systems invulnerable to security breaches.  Customer is responsible for Customers own network 
security policy and security response procedures.  If any equipment or software not provided by CenturyLink impairs Customer's use of 
CPE, Service or an Underlying Service: (a) Customer will nonetheless be liable for payment for all CPE, Service and Underlying 
Service provided by CenturyLink; and (b) any SLA generally applicable to the Service or Underlying Service will not apply. 
11. Miscellaneous.  With respect to the Agreement terms incorporated by reference, Service is replaced with CPE and Service as 
defined in this Service Exhibit.Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
