ACC Business and Customer Proprietary Last Updated 09/01/2015
Services : Service or Services means all products and services (including 
wireless, if applicable) ACC Business provides Customer pursuant to this 
Agreement.
Execution by Affiliates :An ACC Business or Customer Affiliate may sign a 
Pricing Schedule in its own name.  Such Affiliate contract will be a separate but 
associated contract incorporating the terms of this Agreement. Customer and 
ACC Business will cause respective Affiliates to comply with any such separate, 
associated contract(s). An Affiliate of a party is an entity that controls, is 
controlled by or is under common control with such party.
License and Other Terms :Software, Purchased Equipment and Third -Party 
Services (a service provided directly to Customer by a third party under a 
separate agreement between Customer and the third party) may be provided 
subject to the terms of a separate license or other agreement between Customer 
and either the licensor, the third -party service provider or the manufacturer. 
Customers execution of the Pricing Schedule for or placement of an Order for 
Software, Purchased Equipment or Third -Party Services is Customers agreement 
to comply with such separate agreement. Unless a Service Publication specifies 
otherwise, ACC Business sole responsibility with respect to Third -Party 
Services is to place Customers orders for Third -Party Services, except that 
AT&T or ACC Business may invoice and collect payment from Customer for the 
Third -Party Services.
Pricing and Pricing Schedule Term; Terms Applicable After End of 
Pricing Schedule Term : Prices listed in a Pricing Schedule are stabilized until 
the end of the Pricing Schedule Term, including applicable extensions, (Pricing 
Schedule Term) and apply in lieu of corresponding prices in the applicable 
Service Publication. No promotions, credits, discounts or waivers set forth in a 
Service Publication apply. At the end of the Pricing Schedule Term, Customer 
may continue Service (subject to any applicable notice or other requirements in a 
Service Publication for Customer to terminate a Service Component) on a month -
to-month basis at the prices, terms and conditions in effect on the last day of the 
Pricing Schedule Term. ACC Business may change such prices, terms or 
conditions on 30 days prior notice to Customer.
MARC : Minimum Annual Revenue Commitment (MARC) is an annual 
revenue commitment set forth in a Pricing Schedule that Customer agrees to 
satisfy during each 12 -month period of the Pricing Schedule Term. If Customer 
fails to satisfy the MARC for any such period, Customer agrees to pay a shortfall 
charge equal to the difference between the MARC and the total of the applicable 
MARC -Eligible Charges, as defined in the applicable Pricing Schedule, incurred 
during such period, and ACC Business may withhold contractual credits until 
Customer pays the shortfall charge.
Termination and Termination Charges : Either party may terminate for 
material breach upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party.   If a 
Service or Service Component is terminated by Customer for convenience or by 
ACC Business for cause prior to Cutover, Customer (i) agrees to pay any pre -
Cutover termination or cancellation charges set out in a Pricing Schedule or 
Service Publication, or (ii) in the absence of such specified charges, agrees to 
reimburse ACC Business for time and materials incurred prior to the effective 
date of termination, plus any third -party charges resulting from the termination. If 
a Service or Service Component is terminated by Customer for convenience or 
by ACC Business for cause after Cutover, Customer agrees to pay applicable 
termination charges as follows: (i) 50% of any unpaid recurring charges for the 
terminated Service or Service Component attributable to the unexpired portion of 
an applicable Minimum Payment Period (as defined in applicable Pricing 
Schedule); (ii) if termination occurs before the end of an applicable Minimum 
Retention Period (as defined in applicable Pricing Schedule), any associated 
credits or waived or unpaid non -recurring charges; and (iii) any charges incurred 
by ACC Business from a third -party ( i.e.,not an AT&T Affiliate) due to the 
termination. The charges set forth in (i) and (ii) do not apply if a terminated 
Service Component is replaced with an upgraded Service Component at the same Site, but only if the Minimum Payment Period or Minimum Retention Period, as 
applicable, (the Minimum Period) and associated charge for the replacement 
Service Component are equal to or greater than the corresponding Minimum 
Period and associated charge for the terminated Service Component, respectively, 
and if the upgrade is not restricted in the applicable Service Publication. In 
addition, if Customer terminates a Pricing Schedule that has a MARC, Customer 
agrees to pay an amount equal to 50% of the unsatisfied MARC for the balance 
of the Pricing Schedule Term.
Billing and Disputes : If Customer does not dispute a charge in writing within 6 
months after the invoice date, Customer waives the right to dispute.  ACC 
Business must issue a bill within six (6) months after charges are incurred (other 
than for automated or live operated assisted calls) or it waives the charges.

unreasonably withheld or withdrawn), Customers Affiliates may be invoiced 
separately, and ACC Business will accept payment from such Affiliates.

basis, except that AT&T or ACC Business passes through to Customer any 
warranties available from its suppliers, to the extent that AT&T or ACC Business 
is permitted to do so under its contracts with those suppliers.

applicable to its business. AT&T and ACC Business shall require its personnel, 
agents and contractors around the world who process Customer personal data to
