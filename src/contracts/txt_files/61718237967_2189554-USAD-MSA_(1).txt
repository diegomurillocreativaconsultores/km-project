MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT 
If USAD initiates legal proceedings to collect any amount due or for recovery of any USAD equipment and USAD substantially prevails in such 
proceedings, and if USAD has included a claim for attorneys' fees and costs in the initial legal proceeding(s) and such fees and costs are 
awarded, then Customer shall pay the reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred by USAD in prosecuting such proceedings and any appeals 
therefrom. 
6. Forms of Payment. Acceptable forms of payment are: company checks, cashier's checks and certified checks, money orders, personal checks 
(for non-business accounts), wire transfers and ACH credits, except where other payment form restrictions are specifically noted in a separate 
Services Agreement Addendum. Checks must be written and payable in U.S. dollar values. Checks drawn on foreign banks and third-party 
checks are not accepted unless advance arrangements have been made. Payment by cash is not acceptable. USAD may accept, in its sole 
discretion, payment by credit card. USAD may impose a surcharge or convenience fee upon the Customer making a payment by credit card to 
wholly offset the amount of any discount or administrative fees charged to USAD. When a Customer elects to make payment to USAD by credit 
card and a surcharge or convenience fee is imposed, the payment of the surcharge or convenience fee shall be deemed voluntary by the 
Customer and shall not be refundable. 
7. Billing Disputes. Customer shall submit all disputes to USAD within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice in question. If Customer does 
not submit its dispute before the end of the thirty (30) day period, then Customer waives the right to dispute the charges. Customer will submit 
all disputes via a written statement containing reasonably sufficient detail together with supporting documentation. Customer may withhold 
payment for only the disputed amounts. Both parties shall use good faith efforts to resolve the dispute within forty-five (45) days from the Due 
Date of the invoice in question. At the end of the forty-five (45) day period, or after USAD makes a decision on the dispute, whichever comes 
first, either party may file to immediately commence arbitration in accordance with Section 25 of this Agreement. Once USAD makes a decision 
on the dispute the disputed amount shall be due or credited on the next invoice. 
8. Right to Assurance. If a Customer suffers a material adverse change in its financial condition, USAD may: (a) request adequate assurance of 
Customer's performance in the form of a cash deposit, and/or (b) decline to accept a Service Order, and/or (c) require changes to the previously 
agreed payment terms. Failure of Customer to provide a deposit or other form of security requested by USAD within three (3) business days of 
USAD's request shall be a material breach of Customer's obligations under this Agreement and shall entitle USAD to all remedies USAD 
would have for nonpayment of an undisputed amount due. 
9. Taxes, Fees and Assessments. Except to the extent Customer provides a valid exemption certificate in a fonn acceptable to USAD prior to the 
delivery of Services, Customer shall be responsible for payment of any and all applicable local, state and federal taxes or fees and any 
surcharges and assessments required or permitted by applicable Jaw. USAD further reserves the right at any time during the Service Tenn to 
pass through and invoice to Customer any existing, new or increased fees, any applicable ancillary fees, any assessments, taxes, regulatory fees 
(specifically including, but not limited to, federal or state Universal Service Fund obligations), or other charges imposed on, required, or allowed 
to be collected by USAD by any governmental agency or third party provider that affect USAD's costs in providing Services to Customer. 
10. Exemption Certificates. Accepted exemption certificates, including but not limited to tax exemption or 499a filing status certificates, shall be 
effective upon receipt. USAD reserves the right to require the submission of updated certificates for such exemption to remain effective. If 
USAD does not collect any tax, assessment or surcharge because Customer has provided USAD with an exemption certificate with inaccurate or 
incomplete information or that is later found to be inadequate by an applicable authority, then, notwithstanding USAD's prior acceptance of the 
certificate, Customer shall be liable for such uncollected amount, any interest assessed thereon, any penalty assessed with respect to such 
uncollected amount by the applicable authority, plus USAD's reasonable expenses and attorneys' fees that result from such proceedings. 
Exemption will only apply to taxes, fees, assessments and surcharges incurred after the date USAD receives the proper exemption 
documentation (Customer cannot receive credit for any taxes, fees, assessments or surcharges already billed). 
11. Equipment. USAD may, in connection with providing Services to Customer, locate equipment in Customer's premises. All such equipment 
shall be listed in the applicable Service Order, which may be amended from time to time if USAD changes the equipment configuration. 
Customer acknowledges and agrees that all right, title and interest in such equipment shall at all times be vested, and remain, in USAD. 
Customer shall assume liability for loss, damage or theft of such equipment while in their care, custody and control. Customer shall return all 
such equipment in the same condition as received (reasonable wear and tear excluded) to USAD upon the expiration or termination of the 
applicable Service Order. If for any reason Customer fails to promptly return such equipment to USAD, Customer acknowledges and agrees 
USAD shall have the right to enter Customer's premises to remove such USAD equipment. 
12. Third-Party Service Charges. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Customer is solely responsible for the payment of all charges and 
expenses associated with any third party-provided services used by Customer in connection with USAD's Services (including, but not limited 
to, payphone dial-around compensation surcharges, Local Access charges, PICC charges, End-User Common Line Charges), plus any 
reasonable administrative charge USAD may establish for its custom ers for administering these pass-through charges). This obligation includes, 
without limitation, any costs or charges incurred by USAD upon any termination or cancellation of any such third-party services.

may terminate the Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice, unless the breaching Party cures the breach during the thirty (30) day period. 
If a breach cannot be reasonably cured within a thirty (30) day period, such cure period shall be extended as may be reasonably required to cure 
such default. If Customer fails to pay any amounts due hereunder by the Due Date or fails to provide any security or additional security within

(i) all billed and unbilled charges which Customer has not paid at the time of termination; (ii) the monthly recurring charge for each active 
Service Order at the time of termination multiplied by the number of months remaining in the applicable Service Order Tenn, (iii) any revenue

Agreement or Service Order multiplied by the number of months remaining in the initial or subsequent tenn on the date of such termination, and 
(iv) all charges incu1Ted by USAD to its suppliers and other third parties for the provision or disconnection of Service to Customer. Customer 
agrees that the actual damages in the event of a termination would be difficult or impossible to ascertain, and that the charges described in this 
Section are intended to establish liquidated damages only and are not intended as penalties. 
15. Abuse of Service. USAD's Services may be used only for lawful purposes and may not be used in violation of any operating rule, policy, or 
guideline set by USAD. USAD will cooperate with law enforcement if criminal activity is suspected. USAD may immediately suspend or
