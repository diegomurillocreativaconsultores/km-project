Ordering Services
Customer may order Service from Arelion pursuant to this Agreement by submitting a signed Order. Each submitted
Order shall be considered an offer from Customer and shall be binding on the Parties only when signed by a duly
authorized representative of Arelion. All Orders shall be subject to availability and acceptance by Arelion. If
submitted, a Customer purchase order document shall be construed solely as evidence of Customers internal
business processes, and any terms, provisions or conditions contained in Customer's purchase order shall be of no
force and effect, and shall not in any way be deemed to amend, modify, supersede, alter or supplement this
Agreement or the applicable Order.
Upon receipt of an Order, Arelion will use commercially reasonable efforts either to accept or reject the Order within
five (5) business days, but may extend this interval for Orders involving the provision of services procured from a
third-party (e.g., local tails). As used in this Agreement, the term "business day" means a day (other than a Saturday
or Sunday) when clearing banks are open for the transaction of general banking business in the country or city in
which a relevant activity is to be performed or the relevant Service is to be rendered.
Arelion will send Customer via electronic mail a committed date by which the Service will be ready (the Committed
RFS Date) within twenty-one (21) calendar days from the date of receipt by Arelion of a fully signed and unamended
version of the Order or, with respect to Services relying upon a service procured by Arelion from a third-party
supplier (Off-Net Element), when Arelion receives the committed delivery date from the third-party supplier for the
Off-Net Element. If the Committed RFS Date is not met, Customer may claim credits according to the applicable
Service Level Agreement. However, if the Committed RFS Date is not met due to reasons attributable to the Off-Net
Element, Arelions sole responsibility will be to pass through to Customer upon request the late delivery credits
Arelion actually receives from the third party supplier of the Off-Net Element.
The rates and charges set forth in each Order relying upon an Off-Net Element are contingent upon the performance
of a site survey by Arelion. Customer shall provide Arelion with timely information regarding each site and access to
the site in order to perform a site survey. If after a site survey or the commencement of work at a site, Arelion
determines that unexpected or additional work, facilities or equipment are required to provide the Service, Arelion
will advise Customer and shall reserve the right to modify the charges for the Service upon notice to Customer in
order to account for any increased costs arising from conditions at the site. If the notified increase is greater than ten
percent (10%) of the total value of the charges for the Service at the relevant site during the committed Service Term,
Customer shall have the right to terminate the Service at the affected site upon written notice to Arelion, Such
termination right shall be Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and shall expire if it is not exercised within ten (10)
calendar days of receipt of notice from Arelion regarding the increase in charges.
Delivery and Testing
When a Service is ready for use by Customer, Arelion will send a notification to Customer by electronic mail. The
date on which such notice is issued shall be the ready-for-service date (RFS Date). Customer shall have three (3)
calendar days to test the Service (the Testing Period), The acceptance date for the Service provided by Arelion
pursuant to an Order shall be the earlier of (a) three (3) calendar days after the RFS Date, or (b) the date on which
Customer notifies Arelion of its acceptance of the Service. Unless Customer notifies Arelion in writing within the
Testing Period that the Service is not functioning in accordance with the applicable specifications, Customer shall be
deemed to have accepted the Service and the Service Term for the Service shall commence on the first day following
the end of the Testing Period.
If Customer believes that the Service is not operating in accordance with the specifications set forth in the applicable
Service Level Agreement, Customer will notify Arelion within the Testing Period and will provide a written
explanation of the problem, including any test data. Upon receipt of the notice, Arelion will re-test the Service. If
Arelion determines that the Service is not working in all material respects in accordance with the applicable
specifications, Arelion will work with the Customer to identify the cause(s) and rectify any problem with the Service
that Arelion is responsible for and notify the Customer when the Service is ready. The process in Section 4.1 will then
be repeated. If Arelion determines that the Service is working in all material respects in accordance with the
applicable specifications or that the cause of the Service not working is within Customer's responsibility or that of a

third-party not contracted by Arelion, then the Service Term will commence as stated in Section 4.1 above.
Security
If requested by Arelion in connection with an Order or a Proposed assignment, Customer or Customers Affiliate or
proposed assignee shall submit a completed credit application. Arelion reserves the right to withhold initiation or
full implementation of Service or consent to an assignment without penalty pending the completion of a satisfactory
credit evaluation and Customer may be required to Pay a deposit or, with respect to usage-based Services, become
subject to a limit on the charges that Customer may incur before a payment is required (Credit Limit), At any time
during the Agreement Term, Arelion may require or revise a deposit amount or Credit Limit if, in Arelions sole
discretion, there is a material and adverse change in Customer's financial condition, business prospects, or payment
history. The amount of the deposit shall not exceed two (2) months charges (and/or, as the case may be, estimated
total monthly charges) under the applicable Order.
\f Customer fails to provide Arelion with a new or revised security deposit within ten (10) business days of a request
from Arelion, then Arelion shall have the right to suspend the provision of Service to Customer without liability
and/or terminate this Agreement and any Orders without further notice or demand. Arelion shall have the right to
apply the deposit to cure any payment defaults (or to pay any applicable Taxes as defined in Section 6.5) and shall
refund any remaining amount paid to Arelion pursuant to this Section without interest no later than thirty (30) days
after termination or suspension of Service.
If Customer fails to pay any charges incurred in excess of Customers Credit Limit within three (3) calender days of a
request from Arelion, then Arelion shall have the right to suspend the provision of Service to Customer without
liability and/or terminate this Agreement and any Orders without further notice or demand.
Invoicing and Payment
Arelions charges for each Service shall be set forth in the applicable Order. Customer shall pay to Arelion all
recurring and non-recurring charges for Service, plus all applicable Taxes (as defined in Section 6.5 below). All
payments due under this Agreement shall be made by wire transfer or ACH in immediately available funds in the
currency specified in the relevant Order to the account or accounts designated by Arelion. Payment shall be made
directly to Arelion by Customer from an account registered in Customers name. Arelion shall have the right to reject
any payment submitted by a third-party or from an account registered to a third-party, and such rejection shall not
relieve Customer of its obligation to make payment in accordance with this Agreement.
The Service will be invoiced as from the start of the Service Term. The invoice will include the monthly recurring
charges for the Service (including committed charges for Service billed on a usage basis) (the MRC(s)) and, as
applicable, non-recurring charges. When the Service Term starts on a day other than the first day of the month or
terminates on other than the last day of the month, the charge for that month shall be determined by pro-rating the
monthly payment by the number of days during which Service was provided.
Arelion will invoice MRCs and non-recurring charges monthly in advance and usage-based charges exceeding an
agreed commitment in arrears. Arelion will provide Customer with an invoice for Service and Customer shall pay
Arelion in full within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the invoice (the Due Date). Subject to the provisions of
Section 6.4 below, if Arelion does not receive full payment by the Due Date, Arelion may (a) charge Customer interest
on the unpaid balance at the rate of 18% per annum or the highest lawful rate, whichever is lower, (b) require a
deposit or impose a credit limit pursuant to Section 5 above, and/or (c) suspend or terminate Service pursuant to
Section 7 below. Customer shall pay all costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees,
incurred by Arelion in collecting past due balances.
If Customer, in good faith, disputes any charges invoiced by Arelion, Customer (a) shall provide Arelion with written
notice explaining the factual or legal basis for the dispute (with reasonable support to identify the nature of the
billing dispute) prior to the Due Date, (b) may withhold the amounts specifically in dispute and identified in the
dispute notice, and (c) shall pay all other amounts prior to the applicable Due Date in full and in accordance with this
Agreement. Failure by Customer to notify Arelion in writing of a dispute by the applicable Due Date of the invoice on
which a charge appears shall be deemed acceptance of the validity of the invoice and charge, and waiver of all
disputes in connection with the invoice. The Parties will make a good faith effort to resolve billing disputes as

expeditiously as possible. If a dispute is resolved in favor of Customer, then Customer shall receive a credit on its
next invoice for the disputed amount. If a dispute is resolved in favor of Arelion, then Customer shall make payment
of the disputed amount withheld by Customer plus interest within thirty (30) calendar days of the resolution of the
dispute.
Unless agreed otherwise in an Order, all prices shall be exclusive of sales, use, excise, franchise, utility, VAT, gross
receipts and any other similar taxes, duties, regulatory fees or surcharges (including federal and state universal
service surcharges or contribution amounts ), or levies (other than income tax) incurred, contributed by or charged to
or against Arelion because of the sale, use or provision of Service by Arelion to Customer (Tax). In the event such a
Tax becomes due or is applicable, the respective amount will be added to the charges payable by Customer and
specified in the relevant invoice. Charges shall not include any taxes for which Customer previously has furnished
Arelion with a valid and up-to-date exemption certificate. If Customer is entitled to an exemption from any Tax in
connection with a particular Service, Customer shall provide Arelion with a current copy of a valid exemption
certificate. Arelion will give effect to any valid exemption certificate on a prospective basis after Arelions receipt of
such exemption certificate. Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Arelion from all Taxes and related
penalties and interest that may be assessed on Arelion for disallowed or invalid exemption certificates. Upon
request, Customer shall provide Arelion with a certificate of tax residency.
Customer shall make payment free and clear of any deduction or withholding on account of any tax, duty or other
charges of whatever nature imposed by any taxing or governmental authority. If Customer is required by any law,
regulation or order issued by a taxing or governmental authority to make any such deduction or withholding,
Customer shall, together with the relevant payment, pay such additional amounts as will ensure that Arelion actually
receives and is entitled to retain, free and clear of any such deduction or withholding, the full amount which it would
have received if no such deduction or withholding had been required.
Suspension and Termination
In the event of a breach of any material term or condition of this Agreement by a Party, excluding a failure by the
Customer to pay amounts due under the Agreement, the non-breaching Party may terminate any Orders affected by
the breach upon thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice, unless the breaching Party cures the breach during
such thirty (30) day period.
Either Party may terminate this Agreement, subject to applicable law, immediately in the event that the other; (a)
becomes insolvent; (b) files or initiates proceedings or has proceedings filed or initiated against it, seeking
liquidation, reorganization or other relief (such as the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or
such other official) under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law; (c) makes an assignment for the benefit of
the creditors or makes an application to a court of competent jurisdiction for protection from its creditors; (d)
admits in writing its inability to pay its debts as they mature; or (e) ceases to function as a going concern or to

In the event that Customer defaults by failing to pay any amount due to Arelion that has not been disputed in good
faith in accordance with Section 6 of this Agreement and does not cure such default within ten (10) calendar days of
receipt of written or electronic notice from Arelion, then Arelion shall, in addition to any rights or legal or equitable
remedies that it may have under this Agreement or by law, have the right to (a) suspend the provision of Service
pursuant to any Order(s) or this Agreement without any liability or further notice until such time as Customer has
paid all past due amounts in full, including any interest, and/or (b) terminate the Agreement and/or Order(s),

of any IP addresses shall terminate and the IP addresses shall revert and be returned to Arelion without delay when
this Agreement and/or any related Orders hereunder are terminated.

this Section 7, or is cancelled by Customer in the absence of a material breach by Arelion, Customer shall pay to
Arelion an early termination charge equal to (a) one-hundred percent of the MRCs that would have become due for

cancellation charges incurred by Arelion as a result of the termination or cancellation by Customer. Such charges
shall be payable within thirty (30) calendar days of the date on which Arelion provides an invoice for such early
termination charges. Customer agrees and acknowledges that the actual damages in the event of such termination
or cancellation would be difficult or impossible to ascertain, and that the charge in this Section is intended,
therefore, to establish a pre-estimate of the loss and is not intended as a penalty.
