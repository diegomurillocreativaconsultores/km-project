Services: Service or Services means all products and services

control with such party.
License and Other Terms: Software, Purchased Equipment and Third-
Party Services (a service provided directly to Customer by a third party
under a separate agreement between Customer and the third party) may
be provided subject to the terms of a separate license or other agreement

conditions on 30 days prior notice to Customer.
MARC: Minimum Annual Revenue Commitment ("MARC") is an annual

such specified charges, agrees to reimburse ACC Business for time and
materials incurred prior to the effective date of termination, plus any third-
parly charges resulting from the termination. If a Service or Service
Component is terminated by Customer for convenience or by ACC
Business for cause after Cutover, Customer agrees to pay applicable
termination charges as follows: (i) 50% of any unpaid recurring charges for
the terminated Service or Service Component attributable to the unexpired

ACC Business and Customer Proprietary
any associated credits or waived or unpaid non-recurring charges; and (iii)

upgraded Service Component at the same Site, but only if the Minimum
Payment Period or Minimum Retention Period, as applicable, (the
Minimum Period) and associated charge for the replacement Service
Component are equal to or greater than the corresponding Minimum
Period and associated charge for the terminated Service Component,

Publication. in addition, if Customer terminates a Pricing Schedule that has
a MARC, Customer agrees to pay an amount equal to 50% of the
unsatisfied MARC for the balance of the Pricing Schedule Term.

within 6 months after the invoice date, Customer waives the right to
dispute. ACC Business must issue a bill within six (6) months after
charges are incurred (other than for automated or live operated assisted
