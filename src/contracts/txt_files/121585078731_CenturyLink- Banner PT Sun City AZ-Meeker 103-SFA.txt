7. 911 Emergency Services-VoIP. You are purchasing a VolP service (Hosted VoIP and CenturyLink IQ SIP Trunk Service, Analog VoIP Service, SIP
Trunk Service, Managed Office Service, Managed Office Essentials, Core Connect, or HCS Service) from CenturyLink. The Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) requires us to inform you about possible limitations to 911 access when using VoIP. VoIP is provided through an Internet connection
rather than over the traditional phone netw ork. This presents special challenges for 911 service. tt is important for you to understand those challenges
and your responsibilities. Below are some specfic limitations of 911-calling with your service. Pease see additional important limitations in the VoIP
Boys ions. CENTURYLINK RECOMMENDS THAT YOU AND YOUR END USERS ALWAYS HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF ACCESSING 911
ERVI ;
[AXWaRNine | POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS SITUATION WHICH IF NOT AVOIDED COULD RESULT IN DEATH OR SERIOUS
INJURY. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AND INITIAL THE 911 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.
(a) Location Limitations. (including choice of telephone number (TN)). 911 emergency services may not be available or may be sent to an incorrect
emergency service provider under certain circumstances, including: (i) when your service is initially installed - on average less than 24 hours, but
possibly up to 72 hours due to the time required to update 911 databases; (ii) if you use your service at a location other than where it was originally
installed, or if you move your handset or soft phone (Device) without follow ing processes designated by CenturyLink. Note: Some, but not all,
CenturyLink VoIP services allow temporary moves of your Device. If temporary moves ae permitted, your VoIP Provisions include the process required
to temporarily change your 911 address. The FCC makes it your responsibility to keep your location address updated in CenturyLinks 911 records; (iii) if
you select a TN associated with a geography other than your physical location (e.g., you chose a Colorado TNw hen you are located in Calif orna).
(b) Other Lim tations. 911 dialing from your VoIP Service might fail for reasons other than physical location. For example, the service may fail or
become degraded for reasons, such as (i) paver outages, CPE failure (e.g., Internet connectivity routers, your data nework and equipment, Customer
premises switches and routers, and other Devices), cable cuts, or any service or broadband outage or degradation (including failures caused by
Suspension or termination of the Service); (ii) maintenance or repairw ork; or (iii) if your area does not have 911 emergency servce.
(c) VoIP Service-Specific Limitations. PBXAAD (Analog VoIP, Integrated Access, SIP Trunk) If your VoIP Service is used with a PBX or IAD,
depending on the technical capabilities of the PBX or IAD and the options you choose to deploy, the number delivered to an emergency service provider
may be different from the number the caller believes is being delivered. For example, a general PBX number may be delivered rather than a station
number on a particular floor. In this case, the number sent to the emergency service provider will not be sufficiently specfic to locate the ste of the
emergency on aparticular floor. Remote BLA/SCA (Hosted VoIP, Managed Office, Managed Office Essentials) The remote bridged line appearance

(°BLA) or shared call appearance ("SCA") VoIP functionality for the VoIP Service allows Customer to program its equipment to ring in 2 separate
locations when a single phone number is dialed (ie., the end users house and business). When Customer moves from one Iecation (and ringing
prerrises) to another location, Customer must provide CanturyLinkw ith its accurate service address. Customer must keep its CenturyLink-Approved 911
Location identified in the service portal up-to-date with the address of its current location. Failure to update the CanturyLink-Approved 911 Location w ith
the new address location w il! prevent Customer's calls from routing to the correct PSAP. Customer should not use the VoIP Service at the new location
until Customer has received a confirmation email at its address of record. Customer's address has not changed until CenturyLink has completed the 911
Update interval. CenturyLink does not support Remote BLAs or Remote SCAs on uf Devices used with any other Century Link VoIP service regardiess
whether such service includes Hosted VolP in the package or bundle. Volce Mail Or its (Hoste an In unk) 911 dialing is
not supported for VoP seats not associated with a stationary Device for example from Vote Med cy Seals), unless: you use another Device to place

use SIP Trunk Diversion Headers when using the Cail Forwarding featurew thVoP Service. Customer shall not send SIP Trunk Diversion Headers on
all calls, and in particular shall never send SIP Trunk Diversion Headers on 911 calls. Sending SIP Trunk Diversion Headers on a 911 call may cause
the call to route to the incorrect PSAP, or to the correct PSAP butw ithout the comect Customer phone number and location information.
Allen TNs (SIP Trunk only) When a 911 call is made from an Alen TN, CenturyLink cannot identify the location of the caller to faward to the
appropriate PSAP. CenturyLink w ill therefore send any Customer 911 calls originated from an Afien TN to a live operator at a third-party contracted
national 911 center. CenturyLink is charged a fee for each such call (currently $75.00 per call}, and will pass the charges on to Customer. To avoid
incurring these charges, Customer and its End Users should not make 911 calls from Alien TNs.
(d) Additional Information. When you call 911, you should always state the nature of your emergency and provide your location and phone number. tn
some cases, the emergency servce provider will be unable to call you back if your call does not complete or is dropped or disconnected, or f you are
unable to tell the emergency provider your number and physical location. Additional limitations specific to your VolP Service are in your VolP Provisions.
