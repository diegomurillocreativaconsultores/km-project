appropriate resale certificates, VAT registration numbers, and/or other documentation satisfactory to the 
applicable taxing authorities to substantiate such exemption status.  
6.5 Billing and Contract Information; Billing Disputes.  Customer represents and warrants that the Customer Data 
provided to Zoom is complete and accurate, to the best of its knowledge.  If Customer believes an invoice is 
incorrect, Customer must contact Zoom in writing within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice, and identify 
the amount in question, to be eligible to receive an adjustment or credit, which adjustment or credit, if any, shall 
be determined by Zoom in Zooms reasonable discretion after reviews of all relevant information. Zoom will not 
make any adverse reporting on Customer while a good faith billing dispute is pending and in no instance if 
amicably resolved.

other party relating to the business, systems, operations, strategic plans, clients, pricing (including, but not limited to, the

Customer Data, and any information disclosed to Zoom by the Customer relating to the business, systems, operations, 
strategic plans, clients, pricing, methods, processes, financial data, programs, and/or products of the Customer.  Each 
party agrees to limit its disclosure of the other partys Confidential Information to as few persons as possible and only to 
those persons with a need to know that are its or its Affiliates personnel and subject to an obligation to keep such 
information confidential.  Except as needed to fulfill their respective obligations under this Agreement, neither party shall, 
without first obtaining the other partys prior written consent, disclose to any person, firm or enterprise, except as

afford such other party an opportunity to seek a protective order to prevent or limit disclosure of the information to 
third parties, and further provided that the party required to disclose such Confidential Information only disclose 
the minimum amount of Confidential Information to be responsive to such law, regulation or court order.  Should

the other party from any actual harm or prejudice as a result of the failure of notification.

Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5) years from the disclosure of the information.  Both parties

least as protective as those the receiving party takes to protect its own Confidential Information, and no less than a 
reasonable standard of care; (b) to notify the disclosing party promptly upon discovery of any unauthorized use or 
disclosure of Confidential Information; and (c) in the event of any unauthorized disclosure by a receiving party, to 
cooperate with the disclosing party to help regain control of the Confidential Information and prevent further

Zoom Master Subscription Agreement 2019 v.2 . Term and Termination; Suspension.  Each Order Form will specify a Service Effective Date, an Initial Subscription 
Term, and a Renewal Term for the Services subscribed to in that Order Form.  
9.1 Term and Renewal; Early Termination.  Unless specified otherwise in the Order Form, a Renewal Term will 
commence automatically upon conclusion of the Initial Subscription Term or prior Renewal Term unless either 
party sends written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of the next Renewal 
Term.
9.2 Termination by Either Party.  A Party may terminate this Agreement by: (a) providing written notice of 
termination without cause to the other party, provided that all subscription terms for all outstanding Order Forms 
have or will have expired or been terminated, or (b) providing written notice of termination for cause if the other 
party has materially breached the Agreement and has not cured such breach within thirty (30) days of written 
notice of such breach.  In the event of termination by Customer under 9.2(b), Customer will be entitled to a refund 
of Charges paid for Services not yet received as of the date of termination.  
9.3 Termination or Suspension by Zoom.  In the event Zoom reasonably believes that any End User is in material 
breach of Sections 2 or 8, Zoom may immediately suspend or disconnect access to such End Users use of the 
relevant Services, prior to termination for cause as provided above and until such breach is cured.  Zoom may also 
suspend an End Users use of or access to any Service if it reasonably believes that such suspension is necessary to 
prevent imminent harm to Zoom, Zooms network, any End User, or any third party communicating with an End 
User.  Zoom may immediately terminate access if it reasonably believes Customer is in breach of Section 2.4.  
Any such suspension, disconnection, or termination shall be without liability to Zoom, and Customer will remain 
responsible for all recurring Charges incurred during the period of suspension or disconnection provided Zooms 
beliefs as to material breaches were reasonable and Zooms actions in connection with such belief were 
proportional to the perceived breach. 
9.4 Termination by Zoom Due to Change in Law.  In the event of any change in Law that has the effect of 
materially increasing Zooms costs to provide Service hereunder or effectively cancels, changes or supersedes any 
material term or provision of this Agreement (collectively Change in Law) either party may, on thirty (30) 
days prior written notice to the other require that they enter into good faith negotiations to revise this Agreement 
to appropriately address the Change in Law.  If the Parties are unable to agree on such revisions within thirty (30) 
days from the date of notice, either party may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect.

according to regularly scheduled deletion protocols.  Zoom shall certify destruction of such material, to Customer, 
at Customers request. 
11. Service Level Agreement.  Zoom shall make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Downtime does not exceed 
0.1% in any month.  In the event of any Downtime of the Services in excess of 0.1% in any month, Zoom shall provide 
Customer a credit in an amount equal to the Downtime percentage times Customers monthly subscription amount for the 
Service.  Customer shall provide Zoom with prompt written notice of any Downtime.  If Zoom fails to correct any 
Downtime situation within ten (10) business days after receipt of such notice, Customer may terminate this Agreement for 
breach per § 9 without regard for any further cure period.

and exclusive remedy for a breach of this warranty shall be that Zoom shall use commercially reasonable efforts to 
Zoom Master Subscription Agreement 2019 v.2 modify the Services to conform in all material respects to the Zoom documentation, and if Zoom is unable to 
materially restore such functionality within thirty (30) days from receipt of written notice of said breach, Customer 
shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement upon written notice and shall be entitled to receive a pro-rata refund 
of the unused Charges that have been paid in advance (if any) under this Agreement.  This warranty shall be in 
effect for the term of the Agreement ("Warranty Period"). In order to exercise this Warranty, Customer must 
notify Zoom within 30-days of discovery of any non-conformity and must exercise the right to terminate within 
sixty (60) days of first obtaining such right to terminate, otherwise the right to terminate is waived.
14.2 Warranty Disclaimer.  EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 14.1, ZOOM AND ITS 
LICENSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND 
WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT 
THERETO, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE CONTINUOUS, 
UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, VIRUS-FREE, OR SECURE ACCESS TO OR OPERATION OF THE

WARRANTY AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW, THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH 
WARRANTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
15. Indemnification.  
15.1 Indemnification by Zoom.  Provided that Customer complies with the terms of Section 15.3 below, Zoom agrees 
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Customer from any third party suits, claims or demands and associated 
liabilities, costs, damages and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees, expert fees and 
court costs) (collectively, Claims) that Customer may sustain or incur arising from (a) infringement by the 
Services of any copyright, trademark or trade secret of a third party, or any U.S. patent, or (b) from any Claims 
arising from violation of section 4.4 (Zoom Obligations for Customer Content) or section 8 (Confidentiality) of 
this Agreement by Zoom or its employees, agents, affiliates, or contractors.  The indemnity in section 15.1(a) will 
not apply to any Claim that the infringement arose from the combination of the Services with software, hardware, 
content, data or other items not supplied by Zoom, if it directly caused the issue.  In the event that the licensed 
Services are, or in Zooms sole opinion are likely to be, enjoined due to the type of infringement described in this 
Section 15, Zoom, at its option and expense, may (a) replace the applicable Services with functionally equivalent 
non-infringing technology or (b) obtain a license for Customers continued use of the applicable Services, or, if 
the foregoing alternatives are not reasonably available to Zoom (c) terminate this Agreement and refund any sums 
prepaid for Services not provided as a result of such termination.
15.2 Indemnification by Customer.  Provided that Zoom complies with the terms of Section 15.3 below, Customer 
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Zoom and its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, 
members, employees, consultants, agents from any Claims directly arising from (a) Customers or Customers End 
Users use of the Services in violation of this Agreement; (b) any infringement or violation by Customer or any 
End User of any intellectual property or other right of any person; and (c) Customers or any End Users violation 
of any Law.  
15.3 Indemnification Procedures.  In claiming any indemnification under this Section 15, the indemnified party shall 
promptly provide the indemnifying party with notice of any claim that the indemnified party believes is within the 
scope of the obligation to indemnify; provided, however, that Customers failure to give such notice shall not 
relieve Zoom of any of its obligations under this section except to the extent that Zoom is actually prejudiced by 
such failure.  The indemnified party may, at its own expense, assist in the defense if it so chooses, but the 
indemnifying party shall control the defense and all negotiations relative to the settlement of any such claim; 
provided, however, that Zoom shall not compromise or settle any claim in a manner which affects Customers 
rights, makes admissions on Customers behalf or obligates Customer to take or not take any action, including 
without limitation the payment of money, without Customers prior written approval, which will not be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Any settlement intended to bind the indemnified party shall not be final 
without the indemnified partys written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld, 
or delayed.

B. Zoom Meeting Services.  Zoom Meeting Services enable Hosts to schedule and start Meetings and to allow Participants to 
join Meetings for the purpose of collaborating using voice, video, and screensharing functionality. Every meeting will have 
one (1) Host.  Chat features allow for out-of-session one-on-one or group collaboration. Further features, functionality, and 
solutions are described at www.zoom.us.
C. Zoom Phone Services. The following sets forth the further terms and conditions that apply to the Zoom Phone Services.

Zoom Phone Calling Plan means the pricing structure that enables Phone Hosts and End Users to access the PSTN, 
as defined below.  Calling plans may be Metered or Unlimited as defined on the Order Form.  
Zoom Phone Commitment means the minimum monthly bundle of minutes that a Zoom Phone Metered Calling Plan 
Customer commits to use in connection with Zoom Phone Services.
2. Telecommunications Provider. Zoom Voice is the telecommunications provider of Zoom Phone Services and sets 
the terms, conditions and rates for Zoom Phone Services.
3.Description of Services.  Zoom Phone Services are cloud-based phone services that use voice over internet protocol 
(VoIP) to provide Customer with the following services and functionalities (as selected by Customer on an Order 
Form):
a.  Zoom Phone Service.  Zoom Phone Service is a cloud-based phone service that allows two-way voice calling 
and private branch exchange (PBX) functionality, including, but not limited to, the following features: unlimited 
extension-to-extension calling (On Net Access),  auto attendant/ interactive voice response (IVR), call routing, call 
queuing, music on hold, call history, caller identification (outbound and inbound), call forwarding, call transfer, 
and call recording. 
b.Public Switched Telephone Network Communications (PSTN) Access. Phone Hosts and End Users can be 
enabled to make and receive calls to the PSTN and be assigned a direct inward dialing phone number (DID) via a 
Zoom Phone Calling Plan.
11
 c.Bring Your Own Carrier (BYOC).  BYOC allows customers to use the telecommunications provider of their 
choice to provide PSTN access and inward DID numbers.  Zoom provides BYOC customers with software that 
enables On Net Access and access to a range of Zoom call management features and functions.  BYOC enables 
customers to (i) have PSTN capability in regions where Zoom does not offer PSTN Access; (ii) maintain 
relationships with currently deployed carriers; and/or (iii) configure deployments for flexibility and redundancy.  
Customer must ensure that its carrier provides all regulated telecommunications services and is responsible for 
telecommunications regulatory compliance.
d.Additional Zoom Phone Services.  Additional functionality such as enabling common area phones, and 
additional Toll Free and DID phone numbers may be purchased as described on the Order Form.
4. Billing and Invoicing. Zoom will bill Customer on behalf of Zoom Voice based on the Charges set forth on the Order 
Form.  Charges based on usage, or overage amounts that exceed the Zoom Phone Commitment, will be billed in 
arrears, the month following the month a Charge is incurred.  No adjustment will be made, or credit or refund given, for 
usage that is less than the Zoom Phone Commitment, unless caused by the failure of the Zoom Phone Services. 
a.On Net Access.  On Net capability will be provisioned by default for all Zoom Meeting Services.  Phone Hosts 
may access and use On Net services at no charge for so long as the underlying license to the Zoom Meeting 
Service remains active.
b.Taxes.  Customer acknowledges and agrees that Zoom Phone Services are subject to certain Taxes and Fees 
(including, but not limited to, assessments for universal service) that are not applicable to Zoom Meeting Services. 
Accordingly, Zoom shall invoice Customer for Taxes and Fees directly attributable to the Charges.
5. Reasonable Use and Right to Review.  Zoom Voice offers unlimited and metered Phone Calling Plans. These plans 
are subject to this Zoom Voice Communications, Inc. Reasonable Use Policy.  Zoom Phone Calling Plans are for 
normal and reasonable business use; unreasonable use is prohibited.  Use of Zoom Phone may qualify as unreasonable 
if Customer (a) engages in business activities that involve continual, uninterrupted, or consistently excessive use of 
Zoom Phone Services, (b) makes any misrepresentations to Zoom Voice that materially affect volume or type of use of 
Zoom Phone Services, (c) engages in fraudulent or illegal use of Zoom Phone Services, including any activity that 
violates telemarketing laws or regulations, or (d) uses Zoom Phone Services in any manner that harms Zoom Voices 
network or facilities or interferes with the use of the service by other Customers. Use that is inconsistent with the types 
and levels of usage by typical business customers of similar size, scope and business as Customer on the same plan 
may be used as an indicator of abnormal or unreasonable use, including but not limited to abnormal call lengths; 
abnormal call frequency; abnormal call duration; abnormal calling patterns that indicate an attempt to evade 
enforcement of this Zoom Voice Communications, Inc. Reasonable Use Policy.  Zoom reserves the right to review 
Customer use to determine if it is consistent with this Zoom Voice Communications, Inc. Reasonable Use Policy.  In 
the event Zoom Voice reasonably determines that Customer may be engaging in unreasonable use, Zoom Voice will 
determine the appropriate remedy and will take action to remedy any unreasonable use, including, at its sole discretion, 
discussing the use with Customer, moving Customer to an appropriate Zoom Phone Calling Plan, terminating certain 
Hosts, and/or otherwise modifying, suspending or terminating Customers Zoom Phone services.     
6. Termination of Zoom Meeting Services.  Access to Zoom Phone Services requires a corresponding license to Zoom 
Meeting Services.  In the event that the Zoom Meeting Service license is terminated, the equivalent access to Zoom 
Phone Services will also be terminated.  At such time, Customer will be billed for any incurred usage charges, and will 
not be credited for any pre-paid amounts toward the Zoom Phone Commitment.
7. Zoom Voice Policies.  Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Zoom Voice Communications, Inc. policies found 
at https://zoom.us/legal may apply to Customers use of Zoom Phone Services, and current versions are attached 
hereto.
8. Zoom Emergency Calling (E911) Customer Obligations.  Customer acknowledges and agrees that Customer has 
read and understood Zoom Voice Communications, Inc.s 911 Customer Notification, found at www.zoom.us/legal, 
which sets forth specific limitations of Zoom Phones emergency calling capabilities and Customers obligations with 
respect to its End Users.  Such obligations include, but are not limited to:
a. ensuring that all Phone Hosts receive Zoom Voices 911 Customer Notification;
b. ensuring that all assigned phone numbers are registered for emergency calling purposes through the E911 link 
within Customers account, and that all registration information remains accurate and up to date; and
c. distributing warning stickers or other appropriate labels warning End Users that emergency service may be limited 
or not available and instructing Phone Hosts to place such stickers on or near the Devices and other equipment 
used in conjunction with Zoom Phone Services.  
12
 Zoom Voice reserves the right at any time to update the Zoom Voice Communications, Inc. 911 Customer Notification 
as necessary to reflect changes in law or technology that affect the emergency calling capabilities of Zoom Phone 
Services, and any such updates shall be effective immediately upon Customers receipt of notice. 
9. Equipment.  Zoom Voice does not supply any Devices or other equipment used in connection with the Zoom Phone 
Services, and accordingly Zoom Voice does not provide any guarantees as to the quality or operability of such Devices 
and equipment when used to access Zoom Phone Services.  However, Zoom Voice does test certain Devices and 
equipment to determine whether such Devices and equipment are supported on the Zoom Phone platform (although it 
has not tested all possible Devices and equipment available in the marketplace).  The summary of Devices and 
equipment to date that Zoom Voice has determined are supported by the Zoom Phone platform may be provided on 
request.  Customer should consult with Zoom Voice prior to deploying any other Devices and equipment.
D. Zoom for Government.  Zoom for Government is the Zoom Meeting Services offered by Zoom in a FedRAMP-compliant 
cloud environment. Zoom for Government enables customers to leverage a limited version of the Zoom Meeting Services in 
a separate, FedRAMP-compliant cloud environment hosted in Amazon Web Services Government Cloud and Zooms 
collocated data centers (e.g. in San Jose, CA and New York), independent of the Zooms standard commercial cloud 
environment.  Further features, functionality, and solutions are described at www.zoom.us/government.  Zoom for 
Government currently does not include availability of cloud recordings and cloud recording transcriptions, though Zoom 
may continue to develop feature parity between Zoom Meeting Services and Zoom for Government.  In addition, Zoom does 
not presently offer its Zoom Phone Services or Zoom Marketplace as FedRAMP compliant.  Zoom Meeting Services and 
Zoom for Government are independent environments and, therefore, data cannot be exchanged between them including, 
without limitation, instant messaging data or chat data.
1. FedRAMP Security Features.  Zoom for Government is authorized as a FedRAMP Moderate ATO.  TLS 1.2 or 
greater is required.  Noted security features include, without limitation, secure socket layer (SSL) encryption, AES 256-
bit encryption, role-based user security, watermark screenshots, firewall compatibility, password-protected meeting 
option.  Zoom for Government also supports single sign-on (SSO) with SAML, OAuth, or ADFS.  
i.Media Data in End-to-End Meeting.  When end-to-end encryption is enabled, all data in transit is protected 
using TLS 1.2 and AES 256-bit encryption.  Data at rest is encrypted leveraging AWS S3 server-side encryption.  
Zoom web services are secure through HTTPS.  In an encrypted meeting, Zoom meeting keys are randomly 
generated per meeting session.  Passwords are hashed/salted using SHA256.
ii.Chat/Notes/Closed Captioning in End-to-End Meeting.  When end-to-end encryption is enabled, 
Chat/Notes/Closed Captioning are transferred with command channel, not data channel; the data travels within 
SSL connection, and there is no extra AES 256-bit encrypt/decrypt for them. 
E. Zoom Marketplace. The Zoom Marketplace, available at https://marketplace.zoom.us, is a site hosted by Zoom to provide 
access to applications (the Apps) created by third party developers (Publishers) that are interoperable with Zoom 
Services, and make them available from both mobile and desktop client apps. Access to and use of the Zoom Marketplace 
and Zoom for Developers (available at https://developer.zoom.us) sites are governed by separate terms and conditions 
available at https://zoom.us/service.  Besides testing for compatibility with Zoom, Zoom does not perform any other testing 
and does not warrant or support the Apps.  Publishers are solely responsible for all aspects of the Apps they publish, 
including content, functionality, availability and support.  Publishers are required to provide their own terms of service, 
privacy policy and support information (Publisher Terms).  Customers who access or download Apps must enter into 
Publisher Terms directly with the Publisher.  Zoom is not responsible for the Apps, their content, functionality, availability, 
or support.  Apps are hosted AS IS and use of the Apps is at Customers own risk, subject to the Publisher Terms.  Apps 
may become unavailable or be removed by a Publisher at any time and any data stored in them may be lost or become 
inaccessible.  Zoom is not responsible for Customer Data transferred to a Publisher, or for any transmission, collection, 
disclosure, security, modification, use or deletion of Customer Data by or through an App.  Publishers may use Customer 
Data as permitted in the Publisher Terms.  Use of the Apps may require Customer Data to be transferred to the Publisher and 
by accessing and using the App, Customer consents to the transfer of Customer Data by Zoom as required by the Publisher.  
Zoom does not support the Apps.  Customer should contact the Publisher for support or questions.  Zoom makes no 
representations and disclaims all warranties, express or implied, regarding Apps and reserves the right to remove an App 
from the Marketplace at any time, in its sole discretion.
F. Managed Domains. Zoom permits Customers to reserve domains associated with their enterprise and to manage any 
accounts that are subscribed to Zoom using that domain (Managed Domain Customer).  Customer may only associate to 
the Zoom Services domain(s) that they own or are legally entitled to associate for use with the Services.   In the event that a 
Zoom account is created or exists on the reserved domain, but is not authorized by the Managed Domain Customer (the 
Non-Managed Domain Account), the person using or creating such Non-Managed Domain Account will be notified that 
the domain is reserved for the Managed Domain Customer and will be requested to change the domain associated with the 
13
 Non-Managed Domain Account.  If the person using or creating such Non-Managed Domain Account does not change the 
domain within the period specified, that person will be deemed to have consented to the Non-Managed Domain Account 
being added to the Managed Domain Customer and to have further consented for all data associated with the Non-Managed 
Domain Account to be shared with the Managed Domain Customer.

 Exhibit B: Privacy Policy
March 29, 2020
Dear Zoomer,
Privacy is an extremely important topic, and we want you to know that at Zoom, we take it 
very seriously. Here are the facts about user privacy as it relates to Zoom and your use of 
our services:
We do not sell your personal data. Whether you are a business or a school or an 
individual user, we do not sell your data. 
Your meetings are yours. We do not monitor them or even store them after your 
meeting is done unless we are requested to record and store them by the meeting 
host. We alert participants via both audio and video when they join meetings if the 
host is recording a meeting, and participants have the option to leave the meeting.  
When the meeting is recorded, it is, at the hosts choice, stored either locally on the 
hosts machine or in our Zoom cloud. We have robust and validated access controls 
to prevent unauthorized access to meeting recordings saved to the Zoom cloud.
Zoom collects only the user data that is required to provide you Zoom services. This 
includes technical and operational support and service improvement. For example, 
we collect information such as a users IP address and OS and device details to 
deliver the best possible Zoom experience to you regardless of how and from where 
you join.   
We do not use data we obtain from your use of our services, including your 
meetings, for any advertising. We do use data we obtain from you when you visit 
our marketing websites, such as zoom.us and zoom.com. You have control over your 
own cookie settings when visiting our marketing websites.
We are particularly focused on protecting the privacy of K-12 users. Both Zooms 
Privacy Policy (attached) and Zooms K-12 Schools & Districts Privacy Policy are 
designed to reflect our compliance with the requirements of the Childrens Online 
Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act 
(FERPA), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other applicable laws.
We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal data. If you have 
questions, please contact the privacy team at privacy@zoom.us or the support team 
at https://support.zoom.us. 
Thank you, and safe Zooming!

 Chief Legal Officer, Zoom 
Zoom Privacy Policy
Zoom is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience 
when using the services we provide, which we generally refer to as Zoom or Zoom services, 
or when visiting our promotional or marketing websites, such as zoom.us and zoom.com.  
This policy explains how we handle data, including what we collect and how we obtain it, 
how we use it, when and if we disclose it, and some of your options for managing your data 
with Zoom. It applies worldwide to all of our subsidiaries and covers all data that you 
provide to us, as we describe below. 
Information that can be used to identify or be reasonably associated with a specific person 
is personal data.  Where the data described in this policy is personal data, we only 
disclose it in the ways we have stated.
In addition to this privacy policy, we have established policies to protect K-12 students 
using our services through their schools for their education. For information regarding how 
Zoom handles personal data of K-12 students who use Zoom through their schools, who we 
generally refer to as school subscribers, please visit: Zoom for K-12 Schools & Districts 
Privacy Policy.
Aside from providing services to K-12 students through school subscribers as discussed 
above under our Zoom for K-12 Schools & Districts Privacy Policy, Zoom does not 
knowingly allow children under the age of 16 to sign up for their own accounts. If you are a 
parent or legal guardian and believe your child has given us information, you can contact us 
at privacy@zoom.us, and we will take appropriate steps to investigate and address the 
issue.  
This policy and the Zoom for K-12 Schools & Districts Privacy Policy may be updated 
periodically because our business, or regulations that apply to Zoom, may change. If we 
make any material changes to the way we handle personal data as described here, we will 
notify you by posting an updated notice on our website. We encourage you to review this 
page regularly for the latest information on our privacy practices. The effective date at the 
top of this policy indicates when the policy was last revised.
Collection And Use of Data
Zoom Services
We obtain data when you use Zoom in order to deliver our services and provide a better 
experience to you.  The categories of data we obtain when you use Zoom include data you 
provide to us as well as data that our system collects from you. When we say customer, 
we mean the person or company that signs up for and has the account with Zoom.  A host 
is someone who can host meetings under a customer account. You or user or 
participant is anyone who uses Zoom. (You and user may also include customers.

 Recordings
If you attend a Zoom meeting or webinar as a participant, the host may choose to record 
the session, and if so, the host is responsible for obtaining consent from you. Zoom helps 
hosts obtain consent from meeting participants by providing visual and audio cues to alert 
participants of a recording. A meeting host may even turn on a pop-up notice which 
requires a participant to click a continue button to acknowledge notice of the recording. 
Recordings may contain personal data and may be stored in Zooms cloud at the request of 
the customer. A meeting host may choose to store a recording of a meeting on the hosts 
local storage device, not in Zooms cloud. When a host chooses to do that, Zoom does not 
have any control over the recording. Our customer may also request that a transcript be 
made of the recording stored in our cloud. The transcript, which may also contain personal 
data, is treated the same way as the recording by Zoom.  
Zoom Phone allows customers to record phone calls, receive voice mail recordings, and 
obtain transcripts of voicemail, all which may contain personal information and also be 
stored in our cloud. 
Zoom does not monitor, access or use the recordings or transcripts that a meeting host or 
Zoom Phone customer may choose to store in Zooms cloud, unless he or she requests us to, 
for example, to provide technical support.  
Attention Tracking 
If you attend a Zoom meeting or webinar as a participant, the host (or their account 
administrator) may have enabled Attention Tracking. This feature is operational only when 
a host is sharing their screen. It places a small clock icon next to a participants name to 
indicate only to the host when Zoom is not the active window on the participants 
computer for more than 30 seconds, when the host is sharing their screen. While Zoom 
may provide certain tools to show that attention tracker is on, it is the meeting hosts 
responsibility to notify meeting participants if this feature is in use. Neither the meeting 
host nor Zoom can see or access any other applications on a participants screen or 
computer. Also, the Attention Tracker does not allow Zoom to monitor what takes place in 
a meeting, and does not apply to meetings where screen sharing is not turned on. Using 
other features of the service does not activate Attention Tracker. 
Zoom Marketing Sites
Zoom may also gather data from you when you visit our marketing websites, such as 
zoom.us and zoom.com. These are our webpages that tell you about our product, plans and 
pricing, features, and other information about Zoom. The categories of data we collect from 
our websites include: data you choose to give us; data we may obtain from cookies or 
similar analytics tools; data we receive from referrals by other customers; and data we 
collect if you choose to answer any marketing communications. As used in this section, 
you means visitors to our marketing pages or people who do the things we describe here.

tell us not to by adjusting your cookie setting. We use such things as cookies and tracking 
technologies from our advertising service provider tools (e.g., Google Ads). Information 
collected includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider 
(ISP), referrer URL, exit pages, the files viewed on our marketing sites (e.g., HTML pages, 
graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. 
We use this information to determine the offers to make for our services, analyze trends on 
and run the marketing site, and understand users movements around the marketing site. 
We also gather information about our visitors, such as location information at the city level 
(which we get from IP addresses) for tailoring advertising and selecting the language to use 
to display the website. 
You have choices about what cookies can be used. You can adjust cookie settings by turning 
off optional cookies in your browsers setting or by using our Cookie Preferences link at the 
bottom of the Zoom homepage. To ensure that you do not receive Advertising Cookies, you 
can adjust the slider at the Cookie Preferences link to Required Cookies/CCPA Opt-Out.

 For more information regarding cookies or similar technologies, please review our Cookie 
Policy. 
Our Referral Program
You can use our referral program to tell others about Zoom. When you do, you will be 
asked to provide that persons name and email so that we can contact them. We rely on you 
to make sure the person you are referring to us has agreed to be contacted. We will send a 
one-time email inviting them to visit the marketing site. Unless that person says they want 
to hear more, we will only use their name and email address to send this one-time email 
and to maintain an activity log of our referral program.
Marketing Communications
You can sign up to receive email or newsletter communications from us. If you would like 
to stop receiving these communications, you can update your preferences by using the 
Unsubscribe link found in these emails, or by emailing unsubscribe@zoom.us.
We may send you push notifications to update you about any events or promotions that we 
may be running. If you dont want to receive these types of communications, you can turn 
off the setting on your device that allows these notifications to be delivered.
Additional Data Uses
Specific Requests. In addition to the uses described above, Zoom may also receive data 
from you for specific purposes. When you give it to us, we use the data for that specific 
purpose:
To keep you up to date on the latest Service announcements, software updates, 
upgrades, system enhancements, special offers, and other information
To run opt-in contests, sweepstakes or other promotional activities 
To provide you with information and offers from us or third parties
If you choose to participate, to conduct questionnaires and surveys to provide better 
services to our customers and end users
To respond to you when you apply to join us (zoom.us/careers)
To personalize marketing communications and website content based on your 
preferences, such as in response to your request for specific information on 
products and services that may be of interest.
Comply with legal obligations. We use data to detect, investigate and stop fraudulent, 
harmful, unauthorized or illegal activity. We also use data to comply with our contractual 
and legal obligations, resolve disputes with users, and enforce our agreements, if needed.
Disclosures
During use of Zoom. When you use Zoom, some data will be disclosed to other participants 
and to meeting or webinar hosts. For instance, when you attend a meeting, your name 
might appear in the attendee list. If you turn on your video camera, your image will be 
shown. If you send a chat or share content, that can be viewed by others in the chat or the 
meeting.
24
 Customer Content, Dashboards and Reports. Customer content, including information 
shared during meetings, information about participants in meetings and any recordings of 
meetings, belongs to our customers. Customers may use this content, which may include 
personal data about participants, for their own purposes. Customers may also receive data 
we collect (for example, participants names) when they generate Zoom dashboards and 
usage reports for themselves.
At the direction of our Customers. As described more below, under the EUs GDPR, Zoom is 
a Processor of customer content and personal data that our Customers may put into our 
systems when they use Zoom. Our customers are the Controllers. We follow their 
directions regarding this data, and may store it, delete it, or disclose it at their direction.
For Legal Reasons. We may also disclose data when we respond to valid legal process 
including jurisdiction. Zooms policies regarding compliance with valid legal process 
preclude cooperation where a government does not have jurisdiction. Zoom may also 
disclose data when reasonably necessary to preserve Zooms legal rights.
To Third Party Service Providers. We use third-party service providers to help us provide 
portions of the Zoom services and give support. Examples of these third parties include 
public cloud storage vendors, carriers, our payment processor, and our service provider for 
managing customer support tickets. They only receive data needed to provide their 
services to us. We have agreements with our service providers that say they cannot use any 
of this data for their own purposes or for the purposes of another third party. We prohibit 
our service providers from selling data they receive from us or receive on our behalf. We 
require service providers to use data only in order to perform the services we have hired 
them to do (unless otherwise required by law). For example, we may use a company to help 
us provide customer support. The information they may receive as part of providing that 
support cannot be used by them for anything else. For more information about our service 
providers, please see our Sub-processors page.
Does Zoom sell Personal Data?
We do not sell your data.
We do not allow marketing companies, advertisers or similar companies to access personal 
data in exchange for payment. We do not allow third parties to use any personal data 
obtained from us for their own purposes, unless you consent (e.g., when you download an 
app from the Marketplace). Our customers may use the webinar service to generate their 
own marketing leads and they may provide marketing information to you. When you 
register for a webinar, you provide your data to the host of the webinar, and if required, 
any consent that you give about your data would be to them, as well.  Zoom may keep the 
data about the registration in our system in order to facilitate the webinar, but Zoom does 
not use or share that data other than to provide the services. A customer may also charge 
for their webinars. Again, that transaction is between the host and participant of the 
webinar. Zoom is not selling any data.
As described in the Zoom marketing sites section, Zoom does use certain standard 
advertising tools on our marketing sites which, provided you have allowed it in your cookie 
preferences, sends personal data to the tool providers, such as Google. This is not a sale of 
25
 your data in the sense that most of us use the word sale. However, Californias CCPA law 
has a very broad definition of sale. Under that definition, when Zoom uses the tools to 
send the personal data to the third-party tool providers, it may be considered a sale. It is 
important to know that advertising programs have always worked this way and we have 
not changed the way we use these tools. It is only with the recent developments in data 
privacy laws that such activities may fall within the definition of a sale.
Because of CCPAs broad definition, as is the case with many providers since the CCPA 
became law, we provide a Do Not Sell My Personal Information link at the bottom of our 
marketing sites. You can use this link to change your Cookie Preferences and opt out of the 
use of these advertising tools. If you opt out, Personal Data that was used by these tools will 
no longer be shared with third parties in a way that constitutes a sale under CCPA.
Data Retention
We will retain personal data collected for as long as required to do what we say we will in 
this policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law. Customers can delete their 
own content.
Transfer and Storage of Personal Data
Zoom services generally store data in the United States, though our global data centers, 
data may come in from wherever users are located. We may transfer your data to the U.S., 
or to third parties acting on our behalf, for the purposes of processing or storage. Our 
customers may choose to have their data stored outside of the U.S; for example, they may 
choose to have their data stored in their geographic vicinity.  We may store local data 
locally in order to comply with specific local laws and regulations. By using Zoom, or 
providing personal data for any of the purposes stated above, you consent to the transfer to 
and storage of your personal data in the U.S., or other location as directed by Customer. In 
certain limited circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, or 
security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your personal data.
Security of your Personal Data
Zoom is committed to protecting your personal data. We use a combination of industry-
standard security technologies, procedures, and organizational controls and measures to 
protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. 
We recommend you take every precaution in protecting your data when you are on the 
Internet. For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of upper and 
lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols when creating passwords, and make sure you 
use a secure browser. If you have any questions about the security of your data, please 
contact  our security team at security@zoom.us
Linked Websites and Third-Party Services
Our marketing websites may provide links to other third-party websites and services 
which are outside our control and not covered by this policy. We encourage you to review 
the privacy policies posted on these (and all) sites you visit or services you use.
Data Subject Rights
26
 Generally, when we obtain personal data, we do so on behalf of our customers. For 
purposes of GDPR and CCPA, our customer is the Controller, or decision maker, for the 
personal data, and we are the Processor, acting as a service provider for, and at the 
direction of, our customer. Processing just means doing something with the data. We are 
typically required to follow a customers instructions about personal data we hold for that 
customer. 
These are certain requests you can make related to personal data about you, which we will 
respond to as much as we can under applicable laws. (See below for other legal rights you 
may have with respect to your personal data depending on where you reside.) 
Access: You can request more information about the personal data we hold about 
you. You can request a copy of the personal data. 
Rectification: If you believe that any personal data we are holding about you is 
incorrect or incomplete, you can request that we correct or supplement the data. 
You can also correct some of this information directly by logging into your service 
account, if you are a customer. Please contact us as soon as possible if you notice any 
inaccuracy or incompleteness.
Objection: You can let us know that you object to the collection or use of your 
personal data for certain purposes.
Opt Out of Sales:  You can ask us to take you out of certain advertising related to 
your personal data by clicking on the Do Not Sell My Personal Information link. 
Erasure: You can request that we erase some or all of your personal data from our 
systems. For instructions on how to delete your account please 
see https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201363243-How-Do-I-Delete-
Terminate-My-Account 
Restriction of Processing: You can ask us to restrict further processing of your 
personal data.  (This just means you can ask us to stop using it for what we have 
been using it for.) This may mean that we have to delete your account.
Portability: You can ask for a copy of your personal data in a machine-readable 
format. You can also request that we transmit the data to someone else where its 
technically possible.
Withdrawal of Consent: If we are processing your personal data based on consent 
that you gave us when we got the data, you may have the right to withdraw your 
consent at any time. For example, if you have signed up for marketing 
communications you can request to be removed from these communications.
Right to File Complaint: You have the right to lodge a complaint about Zooms 
practices with respect to your personal data with the supervisory authority of your 
country or EU Member State.
Sometimes we will not be able to fulfill your request.  If it prevents us from complying with 
our regulatory obligations or impacts other legal matters, if we cannot verify your identity, 
or if it requires extraordinary cost or effort, we will tell you in a reasonable time and give 
you an explanation.

 Exhibit C:  Acceptable Use Policy
Effective May 30, 2019
This Acceptable Use Policy (the Policy) governs all uses of Zoom Services and 
supplements any Master Service Agreement, Terms of Service, End User License Agreement 
or other contracting document for the provision and use of Zoom Services (the Services 
Agreement). Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meaning set forth in the 
Services Agreement. This Policy defines the standards Zooms expects its Customers and 
End Users to adhere to while using the Services.
Zoom Services are designed to promote collaboration and effective working and business 
relationships by connecting users through voice, video and screen-sharing capabilities. As 
such, Zoom Services are intended for business use and purposes.
Customers and End Users may not use the Services to:
1. Post, stream or transmit any content, including live video, that violates this Policy
2. Do anything illegal, facilitate any illegal activity, or promote violence.
3. Do anything that threatens, exploits or otherwise harms children.
4. Engage in any activity that is harmful, obscene, or indecent (particularly as such 
would be understood in the context of business usage). This includes, for example, 
displays of nudity, violence, pornography, sexually explicit material, or criminal 
activity.
5. Facilitate or support human trafficking.
6. Engage in any activity that supports or facilitates terrorism or terrorist 
organizations
7. Engage in any activity that is fraudulent, false, or misleading.
8. Engage in any activity that is defamatory, harassing, threatening or abusive.
9. Store or transmit any data or material that is fraudulent, unlawful, harassing, 
libelous, threatening, obscene, indecent or otherwise inappropriate.
10. Send unauthorized messages, advertising or spam, including unsolicited 
promotional or commercial content or other mass solicitation material.
11. Misrepresent the Users identity or affiliation with any entity or organization, or 
impersonate any other person.
12. Harvest, collect, or gather user data without consent.
13. Violate or infringe any intellectual property or proprietary rights of others, 
including copyrights.
14. Violate the privacy of others or distribute confidential or personal information of 
others.
15. Engage in any activity that is harmful or disruptive to the Services or attempts to 
circumvent restrictions on access, usage or security of the Services. This includes 
transmitting viruses, malware or other malicious or destructive code or using tools 
that mask IP address location or to otherwise circumventing restrictions on use due 
to regulations or account closures.
If you become aware of any violation of this Policy, please contact Zoom 
at violation@zoom.us. Zoom will investigate all reports and take immediate, appropriate 
31
 action where warranted (in Zooms sole discretion). If a Customer or End User violates any 
of the terms of this Acceptable Use Policy, Zoom may immediately terminate the 
Customers account, suspend or terminate access or take any other appropriate action, 
including legal action if warranted.
Reasonable Use
Zoom provides video conferencing services for business collaboration. Zoom anticipates 
that customers will use the services in a reasonable manner given the business purpose. As 
such, Zoom may limit, suspend or terminate access if an End Users use exceeds reasonable 
standards, and may monitor usage based on
meeting lengths;
uninterrupted meeting recordings;
excessive recorded meeting length;
calls made outside of business hours;
other calling patterns indicative of an attempt to evade enforcement of Reasonable 
Use
Zoom may determine that abnormal, unreasonable or impermissible usage is occurring 
based on industry standards and patterns of usage of the Services, and may take 
appropriate steps, including suspension or termination of service. Zoom may first contact 
the Customer and discuss appropriate usage and suitable plans to support valid use of the 
Services.
In addition, Unlimited recording plans cannot, under any circumstances, be used for 
security systems.
Unlimited Calling Plans
Zoom offers unlimited audio calling plans (that operate with video conferencing 
services), and Zoom Voice offers unlimited and metered Voice Calling Plans (the Calling 
Plans). These plans are subject to this Reasonable Use Policy. The Calling Plans are for 
normal and reasonable business use; unreasonable use is prohibited. Use of the Calling 
Plans may qualify as unreasonable if Customer (a) engages in business activities that 
involve continual, uninterrupted, or consistently excessive use, (b) makes any 
misrepresentations to Zoom that materially affect volume or type of use, (c) engages in 
fraudulent or illegal use, including any activity that violates telemarketing laws or 
regulations, or (d) uses Zoom in any manner that harms Zooms network or facilities or 
interferes with the use of the service by other Customers. Use that is inconsistent with the 
types and levels of usage by typical business customers on the same plan may be used as an 
indicator of abnormal or unreasonable use, including but not limited to abnormal call 
lengths, frequency, duration, or calling patterns that indicate an attempt to evade 
enforcement of this Reasonable Use Policy. Zoom reserves the right to review Customer use 
to determine if it is consistent with this Reasonable Use Policy. In the event Zoom 
determines that Customer may be engaging in unreasonable use, Zoom will determine the 
appropriate remedy and will take action to remedy any unreasonable use, including, at its 
sole discretion, discussing the use with the Customer, moving the Customer to an 
32
 appropriate Calling Plan, terminating certain Hosts, and/or otherwise modifying, 
suspending or terminating Customers Zoom services.
33
 Exhibit D:  Zoom Phone Communications, Inc. 911 Customer Notification
Effective March, 2019
This notification provides important information about the ability to connect to 911 
emergency calling services using Zoom Phone Service. Please read it carefully.
Zoom Phone 911 Service: Zoom Phone 911 Service operates differently than traditional 
911 service. The FCC requires us to advise our customers of the circumstances under which 
911 may not be available or may be in some way limited by comparison to traditional 911 
service. Such circumstances include:
(1) Internet Connection Failure. If the Internet connection over which Zoom Phone Service 
is provided is interrupted, you and/or your company will not have access to Zoom Phone 
Service during that interruption and therefore will not have access to 911 service during 
that interruption.
(2) Network Configuration. If your companys network configuration does not permit Zoom 
Phone Service to connect, your company will not have access to Zoom Phone Service and 
therefore will not have access to 911 service.
(3) Service Relocation and Non-Native Telephone Numbers. Traditional 911 service 
automatically sends 911 calls to the appropriate local emergency responder, or Public 
Safety Answering Point (PSAP), based on the users telephone number. Traditional 
Enhanced 911 service (also known as E911) automatically sends 911 calls to the 
appropriate PSAP along with the users address and telephone number. Because Zoom 
Phone Service permits customers (and customers users) to use Zoom Phone Service 
anywhere they have broadband Internet access, and to obtain numbers that may not 
correspond with their current location, Zoom Phone 911 Service functions differently than 
traditional 911 service in certain respects:
Because a users telephone number does not necessarily correspond with the users 
physical location, all users must provide Zoom Phone Communications, Inc. (Zoom 
Phone) with their Registered Location when the company sets up their service. The 
Registered Location is the street address where the users will be using Zoom Phone 
Service.
Zoom Phone will, where possible, automatically transmit a users Registered Location to 
the PSAP. Accordingly, if a user relocates the equipment (for example, laptop, tablet, mobile 
device, desktop phone or desktop computer) used to access Zoom Phone Service, the user 
must update the Registered Location. If the user does not update the Registered Location, 
any 911 call the user makes using Zoom Phone Service will be routed based on the users 
previously provided Registered Location and therefore may not be routed to the 
appropriate PSAP for the users current location.
Once a user notifies Zoom Phone of a change in the Registered Location, there may be a 
delay in making the new Registered Location available to properly route 911 calls and 
advise PSAPs of the users Registered Location.
34
 In circumstances where direct routing to PSAPs is not available, Zoom Phone will route 911 
calls to a 24/7 emergency call center where trained agents will ask for the name, location, 
and telephone number of the person calling 911 and will contact the appropriate PSAP to 
send help. The call center will not automatically receive the users address and telephone 
number.
(4) Loss of Electrical Power. Unless there is a backup system to power the Internet 
connection and any equipment used to access Zoom Phone Service, phone service and 911 
service will not be available during any power outage.
(5) Outbound-Only Extensions. Your company may choose to enable certain extensions for 
outbound-only calling. Outbound-only extensions will not be assigned a telephone number 
to receive inbound calls and may not be used to call 911.
Customer account administrators must confirm that they have read and understood this 
notice before enrolling users on Zoom Phone Service. Customers are responsible for 
ensuring that the Registered Location is kept updated for their users and for complying 
with all requirements of the 911 notice.
Zoom Voice Communications, Inc. 911 Customer Notification For Canadian Customers
Effective March, 2019
This notification provides important information about the ability to connect to 911 
emergency calling services using Zoom Phone Service. Please read it carefully.
Zoom Phone 911 Service: Zoom Phone 911 Service operates differently than traditional 
911 service. The CRTC requires us to advise our customers of the circumstances under 
which 911 may not be available or may be in some way limited by comparison to 
traditional 911 service. Such circumstances include:
(1) Be prepared during any service interruption . VoIP phone service depends not only on 
your continued subscription (and payment) for the service, but also on Internet 
connectivity and power to function. In the event of power, network, or Internet outages 
(including congestion), or if your service is disconnected or suspended due to non-
payment, you may experience a failure, disruption or delay in your 9-1-1 service. We 
recommend that you keep an alternative phone service (such as a cellular telephone) 
handy to increase the reliability of your access to emergency services during any service 
interruption.
(2) Do not disconnect. Until you are told to do so by an emergency dispatcher, do not 
disconnect your 9-1-1 call. If you are inadvertently disconnected, call back immediately.
(3) Network Configuration. If your companys network configuration does not permit Zoom 
Phone Service to connect, your company will not have access to Zoom Phone Service and 
therefore will not have access to 911 service.
(4) Service Relocation and Non-Native Telephone Numbers. Traditional 911 service 
automatically sends 911 calls to the appropriate local emergency call centre or national 
35
 emergency call centre, based on the users telephone number. Traditional Enhanced 911 
service (also known as E911) automatically sends 911 calls to the appropriate local 
emergency call centre or national call centre along with the users address and telephone 
number. Because Zoom Phone Service permits customers (and customers users) to use 
Zoom Phone Service anywhere they have broadband Internet access, and to obtain 
numbers that may not correspond with their current location, Zoom Phone 911 Service 
functions differently than traditional 911 service in certain respects:
Because a users telephone number does not necessarily correspond with the users 
physical location, all users must provide Zoom Voice Communications, Inc. (Zoom Voice) 
with their Registered Location when the company sets up their service. The Registered 
Location is the street address where the users will be using Zoom Phone Service.
Zoom Voice will, where possible, automatically transmit a users Registered Location to the 
appropriate emergency call centre. Accordingly, if a user relocates the equipment (for 
example, laptop, tablet, mobile device, desktop phone or desktop computer) used to access 
Zoom Phone Service, the user must update the Registered Location. If the user does not 
update the Registered Location, any 911 call the user makes using Zoom Phone Service will 
be routed based on the users previously provided Registered Location and therefore may 
not be routed to the appropriate emergency call centre for the users current location.
Once a user notifies Zoom Voice of a change in the Registered Location, there may be a 
delay in making the new Registered Location available to properly route 911 calls and 
advise emergency call centres of the users Registered Location.
If a users Registered Location is not correct or for other technical reasons, the emergency 
call centre may not have the users address and telephone number. Accordingly, users 
should be to provide their name, location, and telephone number to an answering 
emergency centre.
(5) Inform other Users . You must notify employees, visitors, or other potential users of 
your VoIP service of the nature and limitations of 911 emergency calls. To make this easier, 
attach the stickers provided by Zoom Voice in a visible location on your equipment
(6) Outbound-Only Extensions. Your company may choose to enable certain extensions for 
outbound-only calling. Outbound-only extensions will not be assigned a telephone number 
to receive inbound calls and may not be used to call 911.
(7) Limitation of Liability . Zoom Voice does not have any control over whether, or the 
manner in which, local emergency response centres or the national calling centre answers 
or responds to 911 calls made using Zoom Phones Service. Zoom Voice disclaims all 
responsibility for the conduct of local emergency response centres and the national 
emergency calling centre. Zoom Voice relies on third parties to route 911 calls to local 
emergency response centres and to a national emergency calling centre. Zoom disclaims 
any and all liability or responsibility in the event such third party routes calls incorrectly or 
the data used to route calls is incorrect. Neither Zoom Voice nor its officers, directors, 
employees, affiliates, agents and any other service providers who provides service to you in 
connection with Zoom Phone Service (Zoom Indemnitees) may be held liable for any 
claims, damages, or losses, fines, penalties, costs and expenses arising from or relating to 
36
 Zoom Phones 911 Service (collectively, Claims), and you hereby waive any and all such 
Claims unless such Claims arise from Zooms gross negligence, recklessness or willful 
misconduct. You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Zoom Indemnitees from any 
Claims by, or on behalf of, your or any third party relating to the absence, failure or outage 
of Zoom Phone Service, incorrectly routed 911 calls, and/or the inability of any user of the 
Service to be able to use 911 service or access emergency service personnel.
Customer account administrators must confirm that they have read and understood this 
notice before enrolling users on Zoom Phone Service. Customers are responsible for 
ensuring that the Registered Location is kept updated for their users and for complying 
with all requirements of the 911 notice.
