Banks exercise of all its rights and remedies provided by this Agreement. If any change 
listed above occurs, Bank may immediately terminate this  Agreement.

result from a pass through from a Card Network, prior to the effective date of such

the Services, throughout the term of this  Agreement.

equal to the greater of (i) $250 per Merchant location, or (ii) an amount to be determined by 
multiplying $25 by the number of months remaining in the term here of, and multiplying that 
number  by the number  of Merchant  locations.  Merchant  and Bank  agree  that the damages

liquidated damages should be computed as set forth above. Any exceptions to this  
exclusive arrangement must be approved by Bank in advance in writing.

Merchant  in writing  of any such amendment.  All provisions  of this Agreement  shall apply  to

charged for processing the additional Cards and Services. Acceptance by Merchant of a 
new approved Card as payment for a Transaction or use of a new Service after Ba nk has 
sent Merchant notice of an amendment shall constitute Merchants agreement to the 
amendment and the fees or charges related to these  additions.  
(b) From time to time, Bank may introduce new fees or change the rates, fees and 
charges set forth on Schedule A . Bank will provide written notice to Merchant of all such 
amendments. Bank may change the rates, fees and charges without prior written notice if 
Merchants sales volume or average Transaction amount does not meet Merchants 
projections contained in the M erchant Application form to which this Agreement is attached 
or if the risk factors associated with processing Transactions increase. If notice is r equired, 
Bank  will give written  notice  on the Merchant  Statement.  All new rates,  fees and charges  will 
become effective for the month immediately following the month in which the notice 
appeared on the Merchant Statement unless Merchant terminates this Agreement in 
accordance with Section  28. 
(c) Bank may amend this Agreement in any manner other than as described in Section 
31(a) or 31(b) above simply by providing written notice of such amendment to Merchant, 
and such amendment shall become effective on the latter of: (i) the date on which such 
written notice  is received  by Merchant;  or (ii) a date specified  by Bank  in such  written  notice.  
36. Assignment . This Agreement may not be assigned, directly or by operation of law, by 
Merchant without the prior written consent of Bank . Bank may assign this Agreement 
without limitation. Assignment of this Agreement by Bank shall relieve Bank of any further 
obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the 
benefit  of the parties  respective  heirs,  personal  representatives,  successors  and assigns.

construed  as a contract  to extend  financial  accommodations  for the benefit  of Merchant.

41. Severability; Conflict with Rules . If any provisions of this Agreement shall be held, or 
deemed to be, or shall in fact be, inoperative or unenforceable as applied in any particular 
situation, such circumstance shall not have the effect of rendering any other provision or 
provisions herei n contained invalid, inoperative or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever. 
The invalidity of any one or more phrases, sentences, clauses or sections herein contained 
shall not affect the remaining portions of this Agreemen t or any part hereof. In the event of 
a conflict  between  this Agreement  and the Rules,  the Rules  shall  govern  and control.

Williamson County, Texas and such courts shall h ave exclusive jurisdiction over any 
action, claims, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating (directly or indirectly) to this 
Agreement or any personal guarantee related hereto.  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW, MERCHANT AND BANK WAIVE ANY R IGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN 
ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDINGS REGARDING ANY LITIGATION RELATED TO THIS 
AGREEMENT AND EACH AGREE THAT ANY SUCH ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS WILL 
BE TRIED A JUDGE WITHOUT A JURY.  
44. Third -Party Beneficiary . Banks respective affiliates and any third party Bank uses in 
providing  the Services  are third party  beneficiaries  of this Agreement  and each  of them  may 
enforce its provisions as it was a party hereto. Except as expressly provided in this 
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer upon any person or entity any 
rights or remedies, and the parties do not intend for any person or entity to  be third -party 
beneficiaries of this  Agreement.  
45. Warranty Disclaimer . BANK MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE, 
OPERATION OR PERFORMANCE OR NON -PERFORMANCE OF SOFTWARE AND 
SYSTEMS  UTILIZED  FOR  THIS  AGREEMENT,  WHETHER  EXPRESS  OR IMPLIED,  AND 
BANK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY 
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  PURPOSE.  
46. Captions . Captions in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are 
not to be considered  as defining  or limiting  in any way the scope  or intent  of the provisions 
of this  Agreement.  
47. No Waiver . Any delay, waiver or omission by Bank to exercise any right or power 
arising from any breach or default of the other party in any of the terms, provisions or 
covenants of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent 
breach or default of the same or any other terms, provi sions or covenants on the part of the 
other party. All remedies afforded by this Agreement for a breach hereof shall be 
cumulative.  
48. Force Majeure . The parties shall be excused from performing any of their respective 
obligations under this Agreement which are prevented or delayed by any occurrence not

50. IRS Reporting Information .  Pursuant to Section 6050W of the Internal Revenue 
Code, merchant acquiring entities such as Bank and third -party settlement organizations are 
required to file an information return reflecting all payment card transactions and third -party 
network transac tions occurring in a calendar year. This requirement applies to returns for all 
calendar years after December 31, 2010 and Merchant will receive a form 1099 -K reporting 
Merchants gross transaction amounts for each calendar year. I n addition, amounts payable 
under Section 6050W are subject to backup withholding requirements. Merchant acquirers 
such as Bank, either itself or through third parties, are required to perform backup 
withholding by deducting and withholding income tax from  reportable transactions if (a) the 
payee fails to provide the payees taxpayer identification number (TIN) to the merchant 
acquirer; or (b) if the IRS notifies the merchant acquirer that the TIN (when matched with the 
name) provided by the payee is incorr ect. Accordingly, to avoid backup withholding, it is 
very important that Merchant provides Bank with the correct name and TIN that Merchant 
uses when filing its income tax return that includes the transactions for Merchants business. 
In addition to the fe es set forth on the Merchant Application, if Merchant fails to comply with 
the obligations set forth in this section, Bank may charge Merchant additional amounts 
determined by Bank and may pass through any additional fines, costs or expenses incurred 
by Bank.

legal rights and duties to Merchant electronically.  
(b) Where required or requested, Merchants electronic signature (via click¬through or 
other  method)  on agreements  and documents  relating  to use of the Services  has the same 
effect as if Merchant signed them in  ink. 
(c) Bank can send all communications, billing statements, amendments to the Services or 
this Agreement, notices, and other disclosures or information regarding the Services or
