Communications, LLC but has executed a services agreement for applicable services with an affiliate of CenturyLink ("Affiliat e 
Agreement"), then the terms of the mos t recent Affiliate Agreement will apply to the Service (to the extent not inconsistent with this 
Order); in such cases, the current standard Service Schedule applicable to the Services will apply. If CenturyLink and Custom er have
