increase Service Charges for each Service after the initial Order Term for such Service upon thirty (30) 
days written notice to Customer. BLUE STREAM may charge a late fee for any amounts which are not 
paid when due. Customer shall also be responsible for all costs of collection (including reasonable 
attorneys fees) to collect overdue amounts. If BLUE STREAM fails to present a charge in a timely 
manner, such failure shall not constitute a waiver of the charges for the fees to which it relates and 
Customer shall pay such invoice in accordance with these payment terms.  
8.2 Any amounts not paid to BLUE STREAM within such period will be considered past due. Failure to 
pay charges invoiced or failure to pay on time may result in discontinuance of Service(s), the removal of

information requested by BLUE STREAM. Customer authorizes BLUE STREAM to make inquiries and to 
receive information about Customers credit history from others and to enter this information in 
Customers records and to disclose this information to appropriate third parties for reasonable business 
purposes. BLUE STR EAM, in its sole discretion, may deny the Service(s) based upon an unsatisfactory 
credit history, or may condition the Service(s), which may include requiring (i) pre -payment for 
Service(s) and other charges, and/or (ii) a security deposit, valid credit ca rd on file or bank account 
information (EFT) to secure return of equipment and payment for Services and other charges. Any cash 
deposit will not, unless explicitly required by law, bear interest and shall be held by BLUE STREAM as 
security for payment of C ustomers charges. Customer understands and agrees that EFTs cannot be 
provided solely for security purposes. EFTs provided for security purposes will also automatically deduct 
the full balance due on Customers Account on a monthly basis. By providing a  cash security deposit, or 
a credit card or EFT number to BLUE STREAM, Customer authorizes BLUE STREAM to charge against the 
credit card or EFT or withdraw from any security deposit or account, for: (i) the repair cost or 
replacement value (as determined b y BLUE STREAM) of all BLUE STREAM Equipment that is not returned 
to BLUE STREAM undamaged within ten (10) business days after disconnection of Service(s); and (ii)

balance of any cash security deposit (without interest unless otherwise required by law), and all or a 
portion of the amount charged to Customers credit card or EFT for BLUE STREAM Equipment, if 
payment has been made for all amounts due on Customers A ccount and Customer returns the BLUE 
STREAM Equipment undamaged. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, refunds of less than $1.00 
will only be paid upon Customer request.

federal and state universal service fund fees and/or state and local regulatory fees to the extent 
applicable. BLUE STREAM shall have the right to recover from Customer the amount of any state or local 
fees, charge s or taxes arising as a result of this Agreement that are imposed on BLUE STREAM or BLUE 
STREAMs Services, or measured on BLUE STREAMs receipts. Such fees or taxes shall be invoiced to 
Customer in the form of a surcharge included on Customers invoice. B LUE STREAM shall be responsible 
for and shall pay all taxes measured by BLUE STREAMs net income. To the extent that a dispute arises 
as to which Party is liable for fees or taxes under the Master Agreement, Customer shall bear the burden 
of proof in showi ng that the fee or tax is imposed upon BLUE STREAMs net income. This burden may be 
satisfied by Customer producing written documentation from the jurisdiction imposing the fee or tax 
indicating that the fee or tax is based on BLUE STREAMs net income. Cus tomer shall be responsible for 
providing BLUE STREAM any and all documentation substantiating a claim for exemption from taxes or 
fees prior to the date that Service(s) are first provided under the Master Agreement. To the extent such 
documentation is held  invalid for any reason, Customer agrees to reimburse BLUE STREAM for any tax or 
fee liability including without limitation related interest and penalties arising from such invalid 
documentation.  
10.3  Customer acknowledges that currently, and from time to time, there is uncertainty about the 
regulatory classification of some of the Services BLUE STREAM provides and, consequently, uncertainty 
about what fees, taxes and surcharges are due from BLUE STREAM and/or its customers. Customer 
agrees that BLUE STREAM has the right to determine, in its s ole discretion, what fees, taxes and 
surcharges are due and to collect and remit them to the relevant governmental authorities, and/or to
